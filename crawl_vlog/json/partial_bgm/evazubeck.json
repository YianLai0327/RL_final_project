One of the Maasai traditions that continues to live to this day is the custom of polygamy (or, more specifically, polygyny). As someone with a European upbringing, I've always been taught that a successful relationship can only exist between two people... But that's not how everyone around the world lives and thrives.\n\nI've decided to ask Yayai about what marriage is like in her Maasai culture, and she really opened my eyes to the fact that there is no single recipe for a good relationship (except, maybe, to respect your partner!). I'm hoping you've also come here with an open mind and without judgment - because even if you may not agree with someone's way of life, you should always find a way to respect it (if they're not doing anything to harm you).\n\nI also know that there's a lot that I will never find out about, and of course many other socio-political issues at stake here. But it is not the purpose of this video to discuss them at length: this video is merely a small dip into the idea of polygamy in Maasai marriage, and that's the scope of it.\n\n*Please note that disrespectful or offensive comments will be deleted*\n\n→  Thank you to my wonderful supporters on Patreon:\nPOSITIVE TRAVEL, @inspiring.positive.travel\nHESSA MURAD, @hessstory\nKATARZYNA, @katarzyna_photo_equine\nCARLOS, @carlosonthego_\nJAY PALFREY, @jaypalfrey\nFOUND & LOST\nJUSTIN ANDERSON\nNIKLAS PARRA\nALEXANDRE MUTRAN\nFRED\nCHRISTOPH APFEL\nGARY DELL\nMARTIN\nVEE\nWAYNE HUANG\nCARLITOS\n\rJEFFRY WATSON\n\rPATRICK MCKENNA\nJUERGEN REHBEIN\nDalibor from sLOVEnia\nZubizaretta, @zubizarettta\nSara Rijaluddin\nKristy Tayara\n+ My anonymous Polish friend, J. :)",

We had heard all sorts of myths and legends about this place: the most prominent being that it’s got a sizeable population of rats. We packed light because we treated the trip as a short, initial reconnaissance of the island, to evaluate potential tourism options here in the future! Between friends - it was far from what you'd get on a properly organised, commercial experience 🙂\n\nI’d like to thank my friends Abdullah, Nicola (http://www.wildseaexpedition.com), and Nicolo (https://www.welcometosocotra.com/) who organise proper tours of this gorgeous island with their locally-run experiences.\n\nThis video is being published with a delay of over 2 months - things have been busy ;)",

My privileged way of life, where I get to work on my computer from anywhere in the world, is nothing like the lifestyles of truly nomadic people. And there's fewer and fewer of them left in the world.\n\nOn this adventure, I joined IRANomad Tours and a family of Bakhtiari nomads in Iran - some of the very last nomads in the world - as they crossed the Zagros Mountains. Together with their giant flock of sheep and goats, and other families from their tribe, we trekked over the mountains for a week, towards their summer pasture. It turned out to be one of the most adventurous and life-changing journeys I've taken so far.\n\n→  For exclusive news and behind the scenes, support me on Patreon: https://patreon.com/evazubeck\n\n→  My Patreons:\nPositive Travel, @inspiring.positive.travel\nKatarzyna, @katarzyna_photo_equine\nCarlos, @carlosonthego_\nFound & Lost\nJustin Anderson\nNiklas Parra\nAlexandre Mutran\nFred\nChristoph Apfel\nGary Dell\nMartin\nVee\nWayne Huang\nCarlitos\n\rJeffry Watson\n\rPatrick McKenna\nJuergen Rehbein\nDalibor from sLOVEnia\nBulent Alkanli, @_bulentalkanli_\nSara Rijaluddin\nKristy Tayara\nGeanina Butiseaca\nSteven H\nHarm P\nRyan Luna\nThorsten Strack\n+ My anonymous Polish friend, J. :)",

You can get your GoPro Hero10 here: https://prf.hn/l/6lo9qbl (it's an affiliate link, which means I make a small cut if someone buys a camera)\n\nThis is definitely the hardest thing I've ever done.\n\nAfter training for a year, I finally set off to run my first ever true long distance - you can call it an ultra marathon, or fast packing, in fact, I don't mind what you call it. What matters is that running almost 200km in the mountains was set to be my greatest challenge EVER.\n\nThe Peaks of the Balkans is an incredibly beautiful trail, but if you decide to give it a shot, do not go alone, but rather trek in a group with a qualified mountain guide. I highly recommend Outdoor Kosovo, who helped me with some logistics along the route and ended up being my safety contacts: https://outdoorkosova.com/\n\nI also want to give a massive thanks to Liz, my friend and coach, who encouraged and supported me throughout the whole process.

        "description": "Wow, I still can't believe it. My dream came true. I got to visit the mysterious Socotra Island in Yemen: it's a prehistoric landscape, filled with numerous endemic species of trees and animals you can only find here and nowhere else on Earth.\n\nBecause of its remoteness, and then because of the conflict in Yemen, Socotra has been off-limits to the vast majority of tourists. But I made it 💛\n\nThank you, Welcome to Socotra, for being my perfect hosts and guides to this unforgettable island.\n\nSocial links:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/welcometosocotra\nhttp://www.instagram.com/evazubeck",

You understand, right? 😂\n\nBig thank you to KILIWARRIOR EXPEDITIONS  (https://kiliwarriorexpeditions.com/) for inviting me on this trek. I can't praise them and their staff enough for their professionalism and friendliness. AND of course the Western Breach... ouff.

I've been wanting to visit for the longest time, and got the perfect opportunity after meeting my Kosovar friend Amra on Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/amra.skenderi). She introduced me to a unique wedding tradition that was once very common among the Bosniak Kosovar people. I decided to try it out for myself and travelled to meet with Amra, and her aunt Aziza, who is the last woman in Kosovo to create this traditional bridal look.\n\nAs you'll learn in the video, this bridal tradition is on the verge of extinction. I sincerely hope that Aziza finds other women capable of carrying it forward so that it can continue to flourish here in Kosovo.\n\nP.S. I got 2 COVID-19 tests in the days directly before visiting Aziza in her village, and of course tested negative.\n\n→  Excited to support my work?

        "description": "This is my first video on YouTube where I take a closer look at the darker side of being a travel vlogger. It's a pretty honest and raw video, shot when I was under huge pressure to get back home for personal reasons, but couldn't. Luckily, it wasn't all bad, and by the end I had something of a revelation... \n\nI also just want to make it clear that I LOVE every moment of travel vlogging and think I'm extremely lucky to have this as a job. I'm grateful for this every single morning. But even if you do the things you love, after working 2 weeks non-stop for 14 hours a day, you have the right to be tired. I guess I just needed a day off so I could come back with the unusual energy :) Thanks for your support in these adventures!\n\nFilmed in the beautiful mountains of Gilgit-Baltistan, Northern Pakistan. The town I was \"stuck\" in is called Gilgit, and I was there with an entire film crew, shooting a travel documentary which will come out sometime next year. Note that I shot this vlog myself, without the crew's assistance, haha!\n\nAmmar's YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5wk7xUDoRDRNGeOpGi_mXA\n& his Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/AmmarLuqmanSiddique \n\n---\n\nHi, I'm Eva and I am travelling the world in all the adventurous ways I can.

I'll make sure to check out as many as possible on my next trip to Karachi ❤️\n\nI've been to Karachi FOUR TIMES NOW, and I still haven't found the perfect biryani! Maybe that will finally change in this video? On this trip, I got a chance to experience a side of Karachi I'd never seen before. Going horse riding on the beach at sunset, walking into abandoned buildings along MA Jinnah Road and encountering a few surprises along the way... But have I found the biryani of my dreams?! \n\nA huge thank you to Hamza Akram Qawwal, who let me use their beautiful Qawwali track. Check out their group here:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/HAMZAAKRAMQAWWAL/\n\nAnd another thank you goes out to:\n- Saba for taking me around Karachi's abandoned buildings (www.instagram.com/thelocaltrails)\n- Bilal and his awesome cousins for taking me on a biryani tour of the city (www.instagram.com/mystapaki)\n- Shahzad for the epic drone footage\n\n----\n\nHi, my name is Eva and I'm a travel vlogger currently exploring beautiful Pakistan.

When reactor number 4 exploded at the Chernobyl Nuclear Plant, tonnes of nuclear waste and radioactive materials were spewed out into the surrounding areas, some reaching as far as Western Europe. The consequences continue up until today.\n\nOn this trip to Chernobyl, I wanted to meet the people that still live here, despite the threat of contamination.

CIQAM, based out of Altit Fort (not Karimabad, as I incorrectly stated in the video!), trains and employs women and girls from local villages and impoverished backgrounds, offering them a chance to become financially and socially independent. Out of the 90 women working for CIQAM, 37 are carpenters. This initiative is truly ground-breaking in Pakistan's conventionally patriarchal society - but it comes at a cost.\n----\nHi, I'm Eva and I am travelling the world in all the adventurous ways I can.

The vlogs were filmed a few days ago, and it's now been over two weeks since my arrival.",

But then Mike of Fearless and Far turned my world around (check out his vlogs here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_DmOS_FBvO4H27U7X0OtRg). He took me to one of his favourite joints in town, the food turned out to be a little different from what I had expected.\n\nTD;DR: watch me eat grasshoppers, beetles and other insects in a video where I learn that there's much more to worm-eating than what's on the surface.\n\nMike's original video about this venue:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whj6X60TLFU&t=420s\n\nThe restaurant's Facebook page:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/tlacoyotitlan.mx/\n\nFollow my out-of-the-ordinary travel adventures on Instagram daily!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/evazubeck",

This was one incredible journey in overcoming fear - and I hope to share some of my 'trade secrets' with you :)\n\n#TeamGalaxy #GalaxyNote10 #withGalaxy\n\nI've since used the Galaxy Note 10+ to partly film many of my trips - from Mongolia to Oman to Saudi Arabia and Iraq.\n\nThis video was created as part of a sponsorship agreement with Samsung. I wanna thank these awesome guys for bringing me on board and entrusting me with their very first public product demonstration at the Unpacked event.",
