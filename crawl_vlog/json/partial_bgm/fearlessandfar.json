        "description": "The Hadza Tribe or Hadzabe are a remote African Tribe of Hunter-Gatherers in Tanzania.\nThey live off a diet of plants and animals, eating only what they catch. There are only about 1200 left in existence, and of those, only 400 live traditionally. The Hadza tribe we hunt with are of this small group.\n\nI was fortunate to join them for 2 days in an attempt to catch baboon. Normally in these circumstances, not much is caught. We didn't stop catching animals for 2 days.\n\nMy Secrets on How I Discover & Film Lost Tribes: \nhttps://www.fearlessandfar.com/tribes\n\nIf you'd like to plan a trip to hunt with the Hadzabe, contact GUMBO at:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/the_vigillant/ \nor\ninfo@experientialtravelafrica.com/\n\n#FearlessandFar #Tanzania #Hunting\n\nJoin the Adventure Newsletter\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/join-our-adventure-newsletter\n\n5 Advanced Travel Tips I Wish I Knew When I Started\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/5-advanced-travel-tips-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-started\n\nHow To Make KickA$$ Travel Videos That Get More Views!\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/how-to-make-travel-videos-that-get-more-views\n\nPatreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n♫ Music ♫\n\nThe BEST place for music.

        "description": "https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\nIn this Philippines travel vlog, I head to Kalinga in northern Luzon to find the tattoo artist legend Apo Whang Od. The last mambatok, a style of traditional tattoo found only in the Philippines.\n\nThe people of Kalinga were head hunters. Buscalan, the home of Wang Od was particularly famous for their strange tradition of tattooing. They thought tattoos were beautiful, and the women would cover themselves in full body tattoos to attract men. The men however, would have to earn their tattoos by bringing back the heads of rival tribes. The more ink, the greater the warrior.\n\nAfter being featured recently in a documentary, and multiple TV shows, visiting Whang-Od and her granddaughters has become a tourist attraction. Many people make the trip from Manila to receive one.\n\nIt's about a 12h bus ride north of Manila to Sagada, from there, it's another 4 hours to the trail to Buscalan, then an hour walk.\n\nTo my filipino and filipina fans. Would do you get a tattoo from Apo Whang Od? \n\nBig thanks to my friends Joan of Art, Ken's life Journey, and Hannah for all the help organizing this trip!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a discount from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nJOAN OF ART: https://www.youtube.com/user/bebebeii\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "Sometimes adventures don’t go as planned… After being labeled as spies in the heart of the Democratic Republic of Congo, we fled on motorbikes to the border of the province. Along the way, we ran out of food, and had to buy what we could find from the locals. This is Pygmy Tribe territory, and many eat bush meat.\n\nWe bought a crocodile before flooding our motorbikes a few kilometers later. The sun was setting, we were stuck, so we went the the nearest village with an offer… our crocodile for a night stay in their village. They accepted. I learned this tribe knew how to party. We chopped up the croc, showed each other some dance moves, and slept in straw huts over the Congo River. I can’t make this sh*t up.\n\nYou can’t pay for travel moments like this. They land on your lap, and you make a choice… Let the experience lead you, trust that the world is kind, and open yourself up to the world. Or close yourself off, pity yourself, and curse your bad luck. It’s always your choice. 🐉\n\n“An inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered.” - G.K.

        "description": "I'm a huge fan of Filipino food. Street food in the Philippines is some of my favourite because a lot of it is so different interesting, and tasty. \nAs a foreigner in the Philippines...Why go to a Filipino restaurant when you can get delicious Pinoy street food, and be eating Balut, Isaw, and other strange foods? Manila especially is great for this!\n\nJust a few days before getting my Kalinga Tattoo from Whang Od in Buscalan we visited an Igorot village elder to get his permission to visit his ancestors at a hanging coffin site in Sagada. He was smoking a very important type of Igorot food called Etag. Etag is used in ceremonies in this part of the Philippines, I was interested in trying it because the traditional way of preserving it, invited maggots, beatles and all other sorts of insects into the process. \n\nI'm so happy I was able to spend such quality time with Lakay Wa-Ow, try on his ceremonial necklace, and also buy his Etag. \n\nI'm excited to share the second part at Amir's Birthday Party.

        "description": "While in the Democratic Republic of Congo, we were invited into the forest to hunt with a group of Pygmies. This group is an African Tribe that is known for their short stature, and their hunting ability. During our adventure together, we found all sorts of things I didn't know were considered food, and also attacked by a mamba... which y'know... was fun.\n\nThis is the second part of the adventure. In the first... we had to escape a governor that labeled us spies. We bought a crocodile before flooding our motorbikes a few kilometers later. The sun was setting, we were stuck, so we went the the nearest village with an offer… our crocodile for a night stay in their village. They accepted.\n\n#congo #travel #fearlessandfar \n\nCheck out the previous CONGO videos!\nDEEP Inside VOODOO WRESTLING in CONGO: https://youtu.be/MOdjZEGi9N8\nDressing like Millionaires in Poverty - The Dandies of Congo: https://youtu.be/EzwiiOucpDk\nLOST in CONGO and trading a CROCODILE for a Bed: https://youtu.be/jaC1y44svpE\n\nMy gear, new locations, and cool discoveries in my Newsletter\nJoin the Adventure Newsletter https://www.fearlessandfar.com/newsletter\n\nAll my Video locations on ONE BIG MAP:\nhttps://www.fearlessandfar.com/getthemap\n\n6 Life Lessons I learned to conquer my fears and travel the world: https://www.fearlessandfar.com/fear\n\nLinks to my TV show, Podcast, and More\nhttps://linktr.ee/fearlessandfar\n\n0:00-1:18 Intro\n1:18-1:44 Recap\n1:44-2:50 Waking up in the Village\n2:50-5:26 Trekking to Camp\n5:26-7:21 Thoughts on the Jungle\n7:21-12:15 Hunting Part 1\n12:15-16:45 Cooking, Eating & Dancing\n16:45-19:14 Wake & Bake\n19:14-24:07 Hunting Part 2\n24:07-25:43 Snake Attack!\n25:43-28:22 Cooking, Eating & Outro\n\nStock video from STORYBLOCKS\n\n♥ Friends ♥\nBig love to Obed at kumbukumbutours(at)gmail.com for putting this trip together.

Renowned for their deep connection to the forest, the Baka sustain their livelihoods through traditional activities such as hunting, fishing, and gathering wild fruits and medicinal plants. They have a rich oral tradition, with music, dance, and storytelling central to their culture. Their polyphonic singing and yodeling are particularly famous and are often used during spiritual rituals and celebrations. Despite their remarkable resilience, the Baka face significant challenges, including deforestation, displacement, and socio-economic marginalization, which threaten their traditional way of life. Efforts to support the Baka often center around recognizing their land rights and preserving their cultural heritage.\n\nJoin our Expeditions & Adventure Retreats\n https://www.fearlessandfar.com/trips\n\nBig love to Last Places Travel for putting this WILD trip together for us:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/lastplacestravel\n\nStart your QUEST and claim the Bold & Adventurous life you deserve:\n https://www.fearlessandfar.com/quest\n\nWatch my TOP ADVENTURE VIDEOS\n✦ RAIDING a BABOON CAMP With HUNTER GATHERERS - https://youtu.be/Ny4bHOnSg0o\n✦ A WEEK with the DEATH TRIBE of INDONESIA: https://youtu.be/Oc-wS-qG0_A\n✦ Painful RITES of PASSAGE with the MURSI TRIBE: https://youtu.be/PL45FQyYq8w\n✦ LOST IN CONGO and Trading a CROC for a Bed: https://youtu.be/63jORqZ3WBE\n✦ SOLO Camping in Satan’s Castle Gone Wrong (Shots Fired) https://youtu.be/v0TdYJ653W0\n\nWHO AM I?\nWelcome to Fearless & Far, the most adventurous channel on YouTube.

        "description": "This experience is one of my favourites since I started travelling 8 years ago. \n\nA Kambo Cleanse is putting the poison off the back of a bright green frog into small points burned into your skin. Warriors of Amazonian tribes would use Kambo for its many benefits. After applying the poison, you get extremely sick for a short period after. Extreme fever, swelling of the face, terrible headache, vomiting, dizziness, convulsions, these are all the symptoms of Kambo.\n\nAfter the short allergic reaction your body has to the poison, everything changes. All your senses are heightened. You see more clearly, your hearing improves, you can smell more of your surroundings. Also, your immune system becomes supercharged, making you able to resist infections and disease. Warriors would use Kambo for these purposes, and often apply the poison before war or a hunt.\n\nPsychedelic \n\nComing soon is the middle part of the story. The night we had before kambo. What unfolded that night was completely unexpected. I long session with the shaman and his friend, inhaling rapé (a powder from leaves of the forest), and drinking ayahuasca. It was a warm up before the kambo the next morning, and was equally as intense.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42 \n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nLens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nCamera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nCASPAR DIEDERIK: www.storytravelers.com\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/StoryTravelers\n\nHELDER UERE (OUR GUIDE):\nWhatsapp: 00 55 (97) 98411-7050\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh \n\"Bark Boats 1\" - Peter Sandberg\n\"Below the Horizon\" - Bo Järpehag\n\"Evolution of Days\" - Gunnar Johnsén\n\"Morning Will Dew 2\" - Gunnar Johnsén\n\"Morning Will Dew 3\" - Gunnar Johnsén\n\nAll from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "This isn't your ordinary Philippines travel vlog. I continue my trip north of Manila in the Cordillera region of Luzon. Here I meet an Ifugao Igorot family in Sagada, and get invited to try sever tradition dishes, typical for celebrations in this area of the Philippines. Dinuguan, Etag, Pinikpikan, and more. As a foreigner in the Philippines, and a travel vlogger that will eat just about any pinoy street food... This some some of the most shocking filipino food I have come across in the country. \n\nThis episode of my travel Philippines series takes place after meeting Lakay Wa-Ow, a village elder in Sagada. We arrived at his house to ask permission to visit the hanging coffins of his ancestors who have been places on the cliff faces, long, long ago. He granted us permission, and showed us his collection of smoked pork, called Etag. This putrefying smoked pork is covered in mold and insects, and used in ceremonies in the area. \n\nThe next day I arrived at my guides house where I watched him prepare other traditional foods like Pinikpikan. This is a controversial chicken dish where the chicken is beaten before being killed. Its said the noises it makes attracts the spirits to notice the ceremony, and also brings more tenderness to the meat. It wasn't something for the squeamish, and this was all at a filipino birthday party!\n\n#FearlessandFar #Luzon #Sagada\n\nCome check out the deleted scenes, and fight your fears here: https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\nBackpackers Horizon 3 - Rannar Sillard\nBackpackers Horizon 2 - Rannar Sillard\nExploring Marimba 8 - Merlean\nJungle Walking 2 - Tomas Skyldeberg\nThe Storm Inside (Instrumental) - Daniel Gunnarsson\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "The exploding hammer festival, or \"fiesta del martillo explosivo\" in spanish, is an annual festival in San Juan de la Vega, Guanajuato, Mexico. Every February 28th, thousands of people visit this small little down to see locals tape home made explosives to sledgehammers, and slam then into the ground. The explosions are huge, and injuries are very common. It's a strange festival, and one of the most dangerous in the world\n\nThis particular date, is day to celebrate San Juan Bautista, aka John the Baptist, which the town was named after. No one can remember exactly how all the exploding started... but at one point it took place inside the city. Those who participated would follow the parade in the honour of the saint, blasting the hammers to celebrate. After a lot of damage to windows, people, and cars, they moved the hammers out into a field. Here, hundreds of men can detonate their explosives slightly more safely.\n\nFor travel vloggers like myself, it's the perfect place to be able to film all the action. I was so happy that I brought my GoPro to this event. I almost left it behind in fear that the blasts would destroy it. The little things are tough, and we got some great POV video of some of the locals and their hammers. We spent a lot of our time in the beautiful city of Celaya, which is nearby the festival. Highly recommend you check it out. The tourism board there went to great lengths to help us get the best video possible of the event!\n\nHope you enjoy this video. I stayed up all night to edit it. I love getting these crazy festival videos up ASAP after they happen. I still have adrenaline in my system!

Known for their rich cultural heritage, the Dupa are skilled farmers and pastoralists, deeply connected to their environment. They cultivate crops such as millet, maize, and sorghum, and their society is structured around age-grade systems and community leadership. The tribe holds vibrant ceremonies featuring traditional music, dance, and storytelling, which serve to preserve their oral history and strengthen communal bonds.

You can decide, these cute little creatures have hit it big recently on the web and on TV, but when I visited Pig Beach in 2011, barely anyone had heard of them. \n\nWe were doing a sailing boat tour of several islands and keys in Exuma. The pigs were a little pit spot because we had extra time to kill. Now people travel across the world to see them. I wonder if all their fame has gotten to their head! \n\nIf you love funny animals, I think I know where you should travel next. This has been one of the best travel experiences of my life.

        "description": "Of all the travel tips and travel hacks out there, this one has been the most useful. One big problem with air travel is legroom, especially in economy class. Travel advice and flying tips are dime a dozen, but this simple travel hack with save you a lot of discomfort if you end up with a aisle seat. This is one of the best tips I've found, and one I think everyone should know.\n\nUnder the arm wrest of the aisle seat there is a secret button. Pressing this switch lifts the armrest up, and allows you to have much more leg room, and leg movement, especially when you need to exit the row. \n\n80% of airplanes have this feature, but unfortunately not all of them do. It is there for flight attendants to left the armrest to allow for ease of exit during an emergency, and also for the disabled. \n\nTravelers rejoice, those long haul flights might have gotten a little more comfortable, and air transport a little more enjoyable. It's basically one of my travel essentials now.\n\nAs a travel vlogger, this legroom button has saved my life. Enjoy one the top flight attendant secrets\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Attribution\n\n\"Seats on Airplane.jpg\" used from WikiCommons. \nOriginal creator: Douglas P.

        "description": "My adventures in The Democratic Republic of Congo went about as expected. We wanted to travel to undiscovered places for 3 weeks, and we ended up being labeled as spies, fled to the jungle, had to trade a crocodile for a bed, and got lost along the way. While in the cities, I tried to visit local markets to get a feel for the place. Near the end of the adventure, we found a Pangolin at a bush meat market. I couldn't handle watching this amazing animal die in a bag, so we tried to save it. This is that story.\n\nPangolins are endangered creatures, and are the most highly trafficked animals in the world. Hunted mostly for their scales on the black market, this is not what happens here. In this part of Congo, it's primarily just for food.\n\nMaybe I could have made a better decision. Was buying the pangolin right or wrong? Was it better to try and save it, or just leave it?

As a foreigner in the Philippines, this was amazing travel vlog material.\n\nThe sunken cemetery fell into the ocean with the 1871 eruption of Mount Vulcan. It was built by the spanish, and has seen a lot of destruction over the years. More eruptions, typhoons, and tsunamis have turned this beautiful graveyard into rubble, leaving only a few relics under water.\n\nThis Philippines travel vlog was recorded after leaving my expat friends Kulas of Becoming Filipino, Daniel Marsh, Finnsnow, Bret Maverick, and the fighterboys in Cagayan de Oro, CDO, and continuing for a mini adventure in Northern Mindanao\n\nCheck out my Behind the Scenes videos here!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n#FearlessandFar #Camiguin #Philippines\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nCheck out Hayahay Cafe on Camiguin Island.

        "description": "I've been thinking about this for years. Getting my first sleeve tattoo is a big step in a direction I've been wanted to take for a while.\n\nWhen thinking of travel tattoo ideas, I wanted to pass on the airplanes, maps, and compasses. I wanted to think a bit outside the box, and think of something with a deeper meaning to me. I settled on a flower of life inspired, sacred geometry tattoo because I feel it encompasses how I feel about the world. The concept unites us all together. This video is about getting a geometric tattoo design for men.\n\nThe big idea behind sacred geometry is that we're all connected on a fundamental level through the same building blocks. After travelling the world for 8 years, I can't agree more. We're born into societies that make us think that a kid from North America is very different from a kid from China. But, when you begin to explore the world, you breakdown the barrier that has been created by language and culture. You see each person as just another human with exactly the same wants and needs as you. We're all in this together. Fighting the same battles, dealing with the same worries, taking pleasure in the same joys.\n\nTravelling makes us realize this, and I wish that more people could realize the world is this way.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Would you get one? Are tattoos worth it? Are they safe? Let's chat in the comments, let me know if you have any tattoos!

Darvaza Gas Crater. Derweze. Call it what you want.\n\nTurkmenistan is built on natural gas. I mean this literally and figuratively. In the vast arid Karakum desert lies the 4th largest natural gas deposit in the world.\n\nThe Darvaza Crater was a mining disaster. So they think. No one really knows, as I don’t believe there were any survivors. In 1971 a soviet mining operation punctured the eggshell surface and fell into a pit. Years later, someone lit a match, and Bang! Welcome to the door to hell. \n\nThis is the main attraction in Turkmenistan, and our plan was to roast marshmallows over it. If you missed that travel vlog, you'll want to check it out: https://youtu.be/MhkLTUvBlX8\n\nAs the president has opened up the country slightly over the years, it is now possible to visit.

        "description": "Mosquito Bay or Bio Bay in Vieques, Puerto Rico is an amazing place. It is the brightest glowing bioluminescent bay in the world. I jumped on a few kayak tours during the night of a new moon and saw this incredible light show.\n\nHonestly, it was more amazing that I imagined. I had read a review or two, but wasn't sure if it was worth the trip to the island. It was. The bay is extremely bright, and until now, it was very hard to capture on camera. I recently picked up a Sony a7s which is a beast in low light, and was impressed with that it could capture. This has rarely ever been caught on Camera. \n\nThe government is doing a good job at keeping this place pristine. In some areas of the world you can jump in, splash around, use gasoline engines, and generally just destroy the ecosystem these little guys live in. Here in Vieques, Puerto Rico, you are not allowed to swim, or use gasoline. Nearby light pollution has to be kept to a minimum, and there give Bio Bay some days off now and again to recover. This is probably why it remains the brightest in the world. High Five for sustainable eco tourism. I wish everywhere was this forward thinking. \n\nThis was one of my best travel experiences. Like I said, it's worth the trip!\n\nMore Underwater Adventures: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW_NNmw_ILi386Ue50lt7tcO9RmkgLEQb\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nMy Steadicam to keep things Balanced: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nBig love to Black Beard Sports who had me out on a couple boats.

        "description": "The Bulls of Fire have many names; “Toros de Fuego, “Toros de fuegos artificiales”, or simply “Toritos” aka “little bulls”. Tultepec, a small town in the State of Mexico has fully embraced these spinning firework covered paper animals, to the point that over 500 will be lit on fire for this year’s 2018 Feria Nacional de la Pirotecnia, The Mexican National Pyrotechnic Festival. One of the craziest festivals I have ever been to.\n\nEvery year just an hour north of Mexico City, Tultepec has this 10 day festival celebrating the patron saint of Fireworks, Juan de Dios.\nThis community is known throughout the country for it’s homemade fireworks. Most families here have ties to the pyrotechnic industry, and it is evident, as many wear the scars of their work proudly.\n\nOriginally from Spain, the Fire Bulls can be seen across Latin America under the name Vaca Locas or Crazy Cows. The origin of the bulls is thought to have been a spin off of the actual Bulls of Fire, where wicks are tied to the horns of real animals.\n\nHonestly, I’m not sure which is more dangerous. Running from a single angry bull with two horns of fire, or from 20 drunk men pushing a paper-made, rocket covered bull the size of a bus… both I’m sure get the adrenaline flowing pretty fast. \n\nFamily, neighbourhoods, and friends get together to make these beautiful creations and parade them through the town before the big event later that night. In the video you can see two things, that the festival is quite dangerous, and that the people were incredibly friendly.

        "description": "Filipino food is very diverse. From the street food in Manila, to the seafood on the coast, there's one food that wins the contest for most filipino of them all. When you travel Philippines, you see Lechon everywhere.\n\nI had never had this Iconic Pinoy food yet, and while travelling Mindanao with the fighter boys, a unique opportunity came our way. \n\nBecoming Filipino, Daniel Marsh, Finn Snow, and Bret Maverick and I were in Marihatag in Surigao del Sur. There was a little local festival happening and a lechon was going to be prepared, and if we wanted, we could slaughter the pig.\n\nThis immediately polarized the group. Killing animals for fun is wrong and immoral, no one wants to watch it, let alone do it. \n\nBut... Every time we choose to eat meat. A steak, a piece of fried chicken, a hotdog, an animal dies. Some of these animals live happy lives where they are free to roam, and others live horrible lives inside filthy cages. If we eat fast food, we promote this terrible way of treating life, if we eat lechon (or hunt) we promote the first way, the natural and free way. So then which is worse?\n\nEither way, an animal lives and dies to feed another animal. If you choose to eat meat, shouldn't you understand this? Shouldn't you put the connection of a life to your choice? Bacon is not a vegetable, but it's treated that way when we buy it in the supermarket. Shouldn't we think about it differently?\n\nThese were all the questions ringing through my head, and this is why I chose to do it. To understand the consequences of eating meat, and to help guide my future decisions. The question I have for you is, what would you do?\n\nFor more behind the scenes, checn out: https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nBecoming Filipino:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Jennermann\n\nDaniel Marsh:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiNCvGzwadWCZIzTUjoApRQ\n\nBret Maverick:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/27bretzki\n\nFinn Snow:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Finnur12345\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a discount from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Feel Good Instrumental\"  - Broke for Free\n\"Full of Stress\" - Niklas Gustavsson (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\"Golden Hour\" - Broke for Free\n\"I Go Blind\"  - Martin Hall (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\"Abstract Lounge\" - Dolphin Mind Music\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "We're train surfing the longest train in the world. The Mauritania Railway.\n\nThe Sahara Freight crosses 700km of desert (430 miles) in West Africa, picking up iron ore from the mining town of Zouerat, and dropping it off at the coastal town of Nouadibou since 1963. This Sahara railway is one of the most extreme in the world. It's been called Africa's Worst Train, and for train surfing, it's the ride of a lifetime. The Mauritania Railway is one of a kind.\n\nJust sneaking into the train was an adventure enough. Taking a public bus to Zouerat and trying to negotiate and navigate to the right location. There is no train schedule, just a rough 2 hour window when people expect to see the train. Also, the journey can take anywhere from 16 to 24 hours to complete. Locals ride in the cars as a fast and easy (yeah, believe that) way to cross into the interior of the country from the coast. While where are no clear rules whether it is legal or not, it is tolerated, and has become a common method of transportation across the county.\n\nWould you ride this crazy train in Africa?\n\nJoin the Adventure Newsletter\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/join-our-adventure-newsletter\n\nEXPERIENCES OVER POSSESSIONS SHIRTS\nhttps://shop.fearlessandfar.com/\n\n#Mauritania #Sahara #Train\n\n-------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nCheck out Eva's Channel.

        "description": "The vegetarian festival in Phuket isn't what it sounds like. In fact most vegetarians would stay far away from what happens here. I didn't know what to expect, but this ended up being one of the best travel experiences of my life. \n\nApparently it all started a thousand years ago when an opera group from China travelled to Phuket, Thailand for a show. They became sick, and the locals suggested to wear white and eat vegetarian food as a remedy. It worked, and that's how the festival started.\n\nHow it cascaded into a piercing, possession, and pain tolerance festival, I don't know, nor could I find much solid information on it. It seems the local Chinese are the ones who take part in the sacred rituals and it's said they do it to be blessed with good fortune.\n\nI'll take their word for it...\n\nIf you're travelling in South East Asia, keep an eye out for this crazy festival. There are versions of it in Cambodia, Myanmar, and I believe Singapore. \n\n\nEnjoy this special scary halloween travel video!\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nSony Alpha a7S Digital Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony 16-35mm FE F4 ZA OSS: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 55mm F1.8 Sonnar T FE ZA: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nSony FE 90mm f/2.8-22 Macro G OSS: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\n\nRode VideoMic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nSanDisk Extreme PRO 64GB SD Card: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nPD Capture Camera Clip: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPD Capture Lens Kit: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPD slideLITE Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPD Rain Shell Cover: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\n3 Legged Thing Carbon Fiber Tripod:: http://geni.us/Tripod\nGlidecam HD-2000 Steadicam: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nDJI Phantom 3 4K Drone: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here:\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯",

        "description": "The Day of the Dead Festival in Mexico is an amazing event. In 2016, Mexico City held it's first ever parade. La desfile de Dia de Muertos. There was an insane amount of people there, with the advice from some friends, I tried to get into the press area. The bouncer said a flat \"No\". I kept asking, and some of the locals began chanting \"Let him in, Let him in\", the guy opened the gate, and here we are. I was basically in the Parade. This is why I love travel!\n\nMusic, Costumes, Floats, Dancing, it was an incredible fiesta.\n\nPersonally, I'm used to celebrating Halloween, but they take it to the next level with Day of the Dead. Families from all over Mexico celebrate the lives of those who have passed away, and give offerings to help them in the afterlife. Over the past few years (with the help of Spectre, the James Bond movie) Dia de Muertos has now become an international sensation, with people from all over the world dressing up as the female skeleton La Calavera Catrina for Halloween.\n\nBeing able to produce this was a surprise. I rushed to get it posted. This just happened a few hours ago.

From there, things get even wilder—a controversial encounter with the infamous “Hyena Men,” a group known for their surreal (and heavily criticized) street performances with wild animals. But the day doesn't end there. We travel deep into the bush to witness a traditional Fulani whipping ceremony, a brutal test of manhood… which unexpectedly spirals into a direction I didn't expect.

It taps into the ancient energy of your ancestors, and often fetishes like skulls and desiccated animals are used in the rituals.\n\nCatch Fétiche was born when traditional beliefs were fused into Catch Congolais, an American-Wrestling inspired sport adapted to Congo. But when Bokoko became involved, it evolved into something completely different. Enjoy this one! It's a trip. (Bonus points if you spotted Ekeko from the Sapeur video)\n\nThe final battle was wayyyy too graphic for YouTube... and while the death of \"Zombie\" was fake, the guts she ate were very real.

You see these magical symbols everywhere; on amulets, in taxis, storefronts, and etched in skin.\n\nSak means to tap, and Sak Yant tattooing is the process of getting any of the thousands of sacred symbols tapped into your skin with magical ink. In this Thailand travel vlog, a leave from Bangkok to travel north to Chiang Mai to join a Sak Yant Tattoo tour with Where Sidewalks End. This is a special type of traditional tattoo. Why getting a bamboo tattoo done by hand poke style is very common. This is much more sacred.\n\nPrevious to this experience, I visited a very famous tattoo temple called Wat Bang Phra just outside of Bangkok, Thailand. Here, the famous Wai Kru Tattoo festival happens every year, Thousands of devotees return to this location to honor their Ajarn, and to recharge the power of their Sak Yants. I received my Gao Yord thai tattoos there.\n\nIn Chiang Mai Ajarn Rung gives me the Paed Tidt tattoo, along with the Silver Tongue Magpies. The 8 directions enchantments means many things, but above all, safety while travelling. The magpies, make your speech more influential. Both solid enchantments for any travel vlogger.\n\nGet the F&F Chains on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\nJoin the Adventure Newsletter\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/join-our-adventure-newsletter\n\n\n#FearlessandFar #sakyant #thailand #tattoo #travel\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nBig love to Rachamankha Hotel in Chiang Mai.

I meet my guide Chris and we make a quick stop to have some Moma before trekking into the forests. My first week in the Philippines has been such an adventure. There is so much to see here!\n\nAs a foreigner in the Philippines, I had never heard of this strange combination of plants called Moma. Areca nut can be found in a lot of places in the world. You can usually see the orange smiles on the people, or the stains in the street. While similar to the Betel nut I had once in Indonesia, this was a different leaf and contained tobacco.\n\nI thought I was ready for this experience, but immediately felt hot, sweaty, and shaky. My whole body started to buzz with electricity, and my heart started to race. The locals do this all day long, but I could barely handle myself. I ended up gagging in the bushes and had to lay down. It was INTENSE.\n\nTo my Filipino and Filipina fans. Would you try this? Would you make the trip up from Manila Philippines to see the coffins?\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a discount from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\nBROKE FOR FREE - \"FEEL GOOD INSTRUMENTAL\"\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "We've finally made it to Siberia on the Trans-Siberian Railway!\nOur first adventure was arriving in Ulan-Ude, near Lake Baikal, and driving hundreds of kilometres into the wilderness to meet a remote Siberian tribe in Buryatia, Russia. \n\nBuryatia is one of Russia's most unique republics. It has a mongol heritage, and the people who live here are descendants of the Golden Horde. The landscape is called The Steppe, a vast sweeping grassland that covers central Asia. Tribes who live here have traditionally been nomadic, making small camps like the one we stay in. This is our documentary of 24 hours with this tribe.\n\nThis experience put us outside our comfort zones. We ate some interesting Russian food like raw sheep liver, rode horses, wrestled, and had the time of our lives. While this experience isn't for everyone, it's definitely for me. This was one of my favourite days on the Trans-Siberian Railway. The people we met in this small village made it especially memorable. You can tell by their faces, that they are kind and generous. We felt right at home in this remote part of Russia.\n\nNOTICE: I had to censor and remove a lot of the content in this video. \nIf you want to see the unedited scenes, It's all on Patreon 💪🏻\nSupport F&F - Watch it here: https://www.patreon.com/posts/ive-seen-some-48-30780887\n\nA bit of a background story. This is a train journey of 10,000 km across Russia, the biggest country in the world. 25 days to visit Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Krasnoyarsk, Ulan-Ude, and Vladivostok. \n\nA big thank you to the sponsors of the #TransSibChallenge\n- Russian Geographical Organization - https://www.rgo.ru/en\n- Svoya Tropa Russia Tour Operator - https://svoya-tropa.com/ \n\nEXPERIENCES OVER POSSESSIONS SHIRTS\nhttps://shop.fearlessandfar.com/\n\n#FearlessandFar #Russia #TransSibChallenge\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\nFRIENDS FEATURED\n\nGARETH https://www.youtube.com/tourist2townie\nRUBEN - https://www.youtube.com/ChannelLetsGo\nYAROSLAV - If you're interested in anything we did on this trip, contact Yaroslav.

In this episode, it's almost the same.\nWe’re in the Bicol Region on the search for the spiciest chili in the Philippines. There are many chilies in this part of the country, and I’m sure you could find some of the hottest in the world like the Carolina Reaper, Habaneros, and many more. But we’re after the spiciest Native Chili which comes in 2 varieties Sili Labuyo, and Sili Mahaba. The plan is to do a spicy challenge with the Fighter Boys.\n\nChilies are rated in Scoville units. For comparison \nJalapeños are 2000 to 8000 Scoville units of spice.\nSili Labuyo is 80,000 to 100,000 Scoville units.\nHabanero is 100,000 to 350,000\nCarolina reaper is 1,000,000+\n\nWhile not the hottest in the world, these spicy chilies definitely pack a punch.\n\nTo end the video, we end up trying another spicy challenge at 1st Colonial grill sili chili icecream.

        "description": "The number one comment on my Apo Whang-Od Tattoo video has been about HIV. I've decided to make a video about it. Is Traditional Tattooing safe? Can you get HIV from tattooing?\n\n7 years ago I visited Wat Bang Pra near Bangkok to get a Sak Yant, a traditional Thai Tattoo. Here I met Luang Pi-Nunn and received a Gao Yord, and several other patterns tattooed on my back in a very similar manner to Bamboo Tattoo. I've always heard about the risks of tattooing, and decided to do more research about is tattooing safe.\n\nWhat was interesting to me was the idea of a \"reservoir\" inside a needle. A hollow area where blood can stay between users of that needle. In a tattoo gun or a syringe, this exists, and a significant amount of blood can be passed from person to person. In a thorn, bamboo spike, or metal rod, this does not, and drastically reduces the quantity of blood passed from person to person.\n\nThis DOES NOT ELIMINATE the risks however, and I strongly recommend you doing your own research before diving into these experiences yourself. I am not a doctor, nor an expert on this matter.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this Behind the Scenes Philippines travel vlog. This was one of my favourite experiences.\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a discount from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Appeased Soundscape\" - August Wihelmsson\n\"Backpackers Horizon\" - Rannar Sillard\n\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "Filipino food is some of the most unique on the planet. Balut especially is a world wide shocker, and a must try if you do travel in the Philippines. However, I noticed quite quickly while traveling through the Roxas Night Market in Davao City, Mindanao. I also saw it while exploring Manila street food. There is another equally strange and common street food in the Philippines, and perhaps it's more widely loved. It's called Isaw AKA BBQ chicken intestines.\n\nKyle Jennermann of Becomingfilipino told me about Roxas market being a great spot for a Philippines travel vlog, and indeed it was. This was Pinoy street food heaven. Lines and lines of stall all selling a variety of Filipino snacks. Before coming to the Philippines I had made a list of food to try by watching Best Food Review Show Ever and Mark Weins travel videos. I was not disappointed when I saw many of them here.\n\nAs a foreigner in the Philippines, I didn't think I would like intestines. It turns out... they are pretty great!\n\nCheck out my BTS videos here! https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a discount from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n“Always Feel\" - Funky Fella\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "This is part II of our experience in the rainforests of Brazil, experiencing traditional amazon medicine with a shaman of the Marubu tribe.\n\nDuring this experience we were allowed to try and film 3 types of jungle remedies; Ayahuasca, Kambo, and Rapé.\n\nRapé is an extremely common practice in many types of ceremonies. A hollow bone is used as a type of pipe to blow a complex combination of pulverized jungle plants into the nose. This powder can be many things, but often the base ingredient is a type of tobacco that is 20 times more potent than the one found in cigarettes. It is used to purify the mind. It cleanses the illness and clutter that blocks us from seeing the truth of our intentions. \n\nAlso used in this ceremony was Ayahuasca, which is a concoction of fermented herbs which allows the user to see the fabric of the universe, giving powerful and colourful hallucinations. However in this instance it was a mild version of this psychedelic mixture used to balance the intensity of the Rapé.\n\nIf you haven't seen the other part to this story, please watch the Kambo: Frog Poison Ritual episode. This is where the story picks up after this video ends.\n\nThis experience is one of my favourites since I started travelling 8 years ago. \n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nCASPAR DIEDERIK: www.storytravelers.com\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/StoryTravelers\n\nHELDER UERE (OUR GUIDE):\nWhatsapp: 00 55 (97) 98411-7050\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\nAmazing track:\n\"Pukam Instrumental” - OGRAD\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh \nfrom Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nLens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nCamera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "The final chapter in my Philippines travel vlog series of exploring the mountain province in Cordillera, Northern Luzon. You're going love love what we found.\n\nWe're on the search for hanging coffins in Sagada. As a foreigner in the Philippines, I was told I should go to echo valley to see the famous hanging coffins of the Igorot people. This area gets hundreds of Filipino tourists from Manila, Baguio City, and across the country every day. On Fearless & Far, we're always on the search for the next level. The deeper experience. The adventure that challenges us.\nI met up with my guide Chris and Angdung and we grabbed our machetes and hiking boots, and dove into the jungle. Looking for other sites that others have not visited in a long long time. We found exactly that.\n\nThe unique death rituals of the mountain people of Cordillera are not for the squeamish.In all my philippines travel vlog experiences, this was perhaps the most shocking and interesting topic I have come across.  \n\nWhile there are hanging coffins in China, and also similar practices in Indonesia, there's nothing quite like what happens here in Sagada, Mountain Province.\n\n#FearlessandFar #Philippines #Sagada\n\n15 Travel tips on how to Find, Experience, and Film amazing places!\nCheck out the free video here on my Patreon Page:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/posts/mikes-15-secret-22726197\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com) \nJungle Awakening - Stefan Netsman\nJungle Walking - Tomas Skyldeberg\nRannar Sillard - Backpackers Horizon\nExploring Marimba - Merlean\n\nAudiojungle.net\nMagic Castle - Kapoti Kapota\nCarillion Dancer - Marco Belloni Music\nAbandoned Sanctuary - Orlando51\n\n“Funky Gringo\" - Funky Fella\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "The door to hell. The gates of hell. Darvaza Gas Crater. Derweze.\nThese are all names for the main attraction in Turkmenistan, and in this travel vlog, we take this adventure to a whole new level.\n\nTurkmenistan is built on methane. I mean this literally and figuratively. In the vast arid deserts of the country lie the 4th largest natural gas deposits in the world, and this is the cash cow that makes the capital Ashgabat, sparkle with gold and marble.\n\nThe Darvaza Crater was a mining disaster. So they think. No one really knows, as I don’t believe there were any survivors. In 1971 a soviet mining operation punctured the eggshell surface of a potential gas deposit in the middle of the Karakum desert, and fell into a pit. Years later, someone lit a match, and Bang! Welcome to the door to hell. \n\nPut this location on your bucket list for 2020. It's worth the three hour drive north from Ashgabat. The new president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov has opened up the country much more than it used to be.

        "description": "Ashgabat Turkmenistan is a strange place. I have never seen so much gold and marble in my life, but the streets seemed empty. In this Turkmenistan travel vlog, I join my friend Lexie Alford and make a trip to a local Turkmen market called the Russian Bazaar. Here, we tried street food, interacted with the locals, and witnessed some real culture.\n\nI say real culture, because Turkmenistan is known as the North Korea of Central Asia. The president Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow has a tight grip on the country, and it's very hard to get off the normal tourist path. \n\nBeside our hotel was a local market, we asked our guide if we could visit, and he said if we really wanted to we could, but not to bring a camera because of police. The locals had been so nice to us, so thought we would take a small chance.\n\nOne more thing to note. After I posted the first Turkmenistan travel vlog in Ashgabat, I had said that we had our US dollars exchanged to Turkmen Manat at 1 to 13. Locals commented that it's actually suppose to be 1 to 20. It's funny though, from an atm it's 1 to 3.5.\nVery happy we got our money on the black market.\n\nSome more links to check out:\n\n5 Advanced Travel Tips I Wish I Knew When I Started\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/5-advanced-travel-tips-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-started\n\nFor some Behind the Scenes videos about Turkmenistan, check out my Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n#FearlessandFar #Turkmenistan #Ashgabat\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nTrover is an app I've been using to discover the world around me over the past year.

In this Philippines travel vlog, myself, Finn Snow, Daniel Marsh, Becoming Filipino, and Bret Maverick AKA the Fighter Boys head to North Cotabato in search of waterfalls.\n\nIn all my years of a travel vlogger, I've never seen anything like this. 500m meters of falls and pools, with only a few locals there. We were quite sure so one had brought drones and cameras to make a travel vlog or take pictures before. We basically had this amazing filipino waterfall to ourselves.\n\nWhile we didn't have time to explore everything, a local came to show us how one of the falls can be used as a waterslide. That changed the day. It was a ton of fun. This place was called Matigol Falls.\n\nJoin the FearlessFam and check out my BTS videos here:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nBecoming Filipino:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Jennermann\n\nDaniel Marsh:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiNCvGzwadWCZIzTUjoApRQ\n\nBret Maverick:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/27bretzki\n\nFinn Snow:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Finnur12345\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a discount from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "This is the top spot for urban exploration in Mexico. El partenón de Negro Durazo is an abandoned mansion on the coast of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, Mexico. This building was the party home of the corrupt police chief, Arturo Durazo Moreno. Nicknamed \"The Black\" Durazo, he stole millions of taxpayer money to build extravagant homes all over the country. Exploring this abandoned millionaires mansion has been on my to-do list for years. I teamed up with my travel vlogger bro Exploring with Cody, and Actress Mariannela Cataño to make this happen. This is one of Mexico's most famous abandoned places!\n\nNegro Durazo was Mexico City's Chief of Police from 1976 to 1982. The beach mansion was constructed in 1979, and abandoned only a few years later. The Partenon was constructed to look similar to the actual Parthenon inside the greek Acropolis in Athens. Negro Durazo only had a couple years of partying before being caught and locked up. He spent 10 years in jail, and then died in the year 2000. The abandoned home has been shut down since 1985. That's 32 years ago. I was it had everything still inside! \n\nScary? Creepy? Cool?

        "description": "Mexico City is filled with markets. Street food especially. But today I teamed up with Mariel de Viaje for something different. A witch craft market named Mercado Sonora. We wanted a special kind of cleanse... one that involved our spirit. Called a \"Limpia con Huevo\"\n\nMercado Sonora is in the South East of Mexico City, in a neighbourhood called Merced Balbuena. To the average person, it appears to be a normal place. Food, clowns, toys, clothing, are all lined up in perfect aisles. If you head to the back, and follow your nose, you can find a section that is not for everyone...\n\nThis is the Witchcraft market of Mexico City. It's filled with all sorts of magic and medicine. Dried stingrays and armadillos hang from the ceiling. Signs for encapsulated skunk and rattle snake posted on the walls. Hundreds of candles line the walls offering spells to increase your sex drive and break up lovers. \n\n\"Que Buscabas?\" Is what you hear from every shopkeeper. \"What are you looking for?\" they ask.\n\nThis is a deeper question than it first appears. It's not cutlery, or vegetables they are offering. Here in mercado sonora they are selling you, happiness, good luck, love... everything you could possibly want in life.\n\nWe were on a search for a \"Limpia\" a cleaning of the soul. A spirit cleanse you could call it. There are many different kinds, but we were looking for one where an egg is rubbed over the body, absorbing the bad energy from your spirit.\n\nThis area of CDMX isn't particularly safe, and it is very forbidden to film inside the market. We had to go incognito on our cellphones.\n\nI met up with my travel vlogger friend Mariel de Viaje and we entered. \n\nIt ended with a hilarious surprise. We may need to go back again to Mercado Sonora afterall\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nThe talented Mariel de Viaje\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/marielgalana\n\nThe lovely Mariannela Catano\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Thieves Adventures 29\" - Magnus Ringblom\n\n\"Appeased Soundscape 03\" - August Wilhelmsson\n\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n\"Funky Gringo\" - Funky Fella\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

Along the way, we lived with nomadic families, crossed vast steppes, deep river valleys, and endless mountain passes. This wasn’t just a journey—it was a raw, immersive experience into one of the last surviving nomadic cultures on Earth.\n\nIn the final stretch, deep in the taiga, we were invited to witness and take part in a rare Tsaatan rite of passage—an honor few outsiders have ever experienced.

Many buildings fell today in La Roma, Condesa and Navarte neighborhoods. \n\nThis happened just 2 weeks after the giant 8.2 earthquake off the coast of Oaxaca. That epicenter was roughly 500 kilometers away from this area. The earthquake of today was a magnitude of 7.9, but much closer. Only about 100km away near the states of Cuernavaca and Puebla. \n\nWe were able to record some it in a vlog starting just a few minutes after the quake, and walked around the area seeing if we could help, and observing the damage and aftermath. As a Canadian living in Mexico, I have never experienced anything like this before, and being an eye witness was very scary. Send prayers to the people on this city.",

Ramen fuels Japan. This beautiful dish is made of japanese ramen noodles, cooked in a fish or meat broth. Miso paste is added, with boiled tamago egg, tender Chasu pork, and a whole host of other ingredients. There are 100 ways to make it, and every one a different type of delicious. If you like street food, this is top of the list in Japan. If you’re on the hunt for a place selling the Best ramen in Tokyo, Kikanbo is a contender for sure.\n\nI saw a travel video from my friend Mark Wiens trying the spiciest ramen in Tokyo, and thought I'd give it a shot myself. \n\nI'm addicted to spicy food, and thought perhaps I could finish it.

Muslim extremist groups have damaged its people and its reputation. As a foreigner in the Philippines, everyone told me to stay away from the south. Mindanao was \"dangerous\" and \"no one should go\", is what I was told by both filipinos and foreign travelers. After the Mindanao roadtrip with the Fighterboys, I would have to disagree. Love and generosity is what we experienced, an appreciation from the people that I have rarely felt while travelling the world. We met the governor of ARMM, our local contact (always have a local contact) and spent 4 days here.

        "description": "Trunyan Village Cemetery in Bali was a challenging experience for me. We rarely see dead bodies in the western world, and we have a very finite view on death. Trunyan village is located deep in the centre of Bali, nestled beside a crater lake and mount Batur, and is quite hard to get to. \n\nHere, they still follow a tradition that was set in place over a thousand years ago. They place their dead under a Terumanyan Tree, supposedly the last of it's kind, to mask it's beautiful scent.\n\nThe legend says that the smell of the tree was so sweet, that people from all over the island would come to try and find its source. The village of Trunyan was overrun with travellers. A man arrived and met a woman, he wanted to marry her. She insisted that before they were to be wed, the man has to find a way to stop the smell of the tree. The man found a very unique way to do so, and so began the tradition of placing dead bodies under the tree.\n\nNow, we can visit the cemetery and see death face to face. There are 11 exposed graves beside the famous tree. The people living here are the descendants of the original Balinse people called Aga, and both the village and the tree derive their name from their language. Taru meaning 'tree' and Menyan meaning 'nice smell'.\n\nThere are a lot of poor reviews of this place. The locals are having a hard time appropriately managing the travellers that arrive. It's also quite small, and depending if anyone has died recently, there may or may not be a decomposing body. I have Yansu's contact below. I highly recommend you contact him.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nMy Steadicam to keep things Balanced: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♫ Music: \"Organica\" - Tim Mono\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Thanks to these Friends  ♥\n\n→ Yansu at Bali Yansu Tours\n→ http://www.beautifulbalitours.com/\n→ https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g297701-d6552897-Reviews-Bali_Yansu_Tour-Ubud_Bali.html\n\nYansu is a legend.

        "description": "Big thanks to Wonderful Indonesia for hosting us this year on the #TripofWonders. This is a bonus before I release some videos of the unbelievable world we saw underwater. Stay tuned!\n\nIndonesia has some great street food, and I'm always trying to hunt down the weirdest, strangest, most interesting foods I can find. This lead us to chewing on the Betel nut (not Beetle nut, though pronounced the same), a green golfball sized fruit of a Areca Palm, that is suppose to be addictive, and give you sexual prowess. \n\nI first saw people chew it in Taiwan. There, it was so famous they made a documentary called Betel Nut Girls, which was about the naked girls standing on the side of the road selling them to truck drivers. All throughout Asia though, you can see the orange stains of betelnut juice on the streets, and all over the teeth of people of locals. It is consumed much like chewing tobacco, and slowly turns teeth orange, rots the gums, and causes cancer. Yum. \n\nThe up side of its effects is that it is a stimulant, and it keeps you awake. Also, the word on the street is that an orange smile is attractive. Locals chew away, spitting violently orange mouthfuls of saliva every few minutes, and look like they just took a bite out of someone's jugular vein. Sexy. \n\nHope you enjoy this travel vlog in Indonesia! Check out my friends who tried them as well.

        "description": "Fairy Meadows Pakistan! They says it's the most beautiful place in the country. In this Pakistan travel vlog, we continue our roadtrip through Northern Pakistan, and embark on a Jeep to the legendary viewing point of Nanga Parbat, aka \"The Killer Mountain\"\n\nThis trip starts off with a ride along the most dangerous highway in the world. I don't think there was ever an official competition, but by looking at the video footage, you can tell pretty quickly it is definitely a contender. \n\n\n\nThis is the second episode in my Pakistan Travel Vlog series, make sure you catch the first where we begin our journey from Islamabad to Skardu in Northern Pakistan. We start out driving from Besham to Chillas, but continue to, Fairy Meadows, Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza Valley, Nanga Parbat, and many other places along the Karakoram highway. \n\nPakistan tourism is on the rise. It's often called a dangerous place to travel. Our purpose was to spend our time, as foreigners in Pakistan to disprove this, and show the beauty of the people and the landscape to the world. CPIC global sponsored out trip, but we did so without any security or military escorts. The only trouble we got into was bumpy roads.\n\nWhile normally I solo travel, I was excited to have so many friends on the trip.

        "description": "Island hopping in Coron Palawan Philippines!\nIn this travel vlog I join Exploring with Cody in a Filipino adventure to visit Kayangan Lake, Twin Lagoon, Barracuda lake, and Skeleton Wreck. These incredible islands have been called the most beautiful in the world. If you plan to travel South East Asia, this has to be on your bucket list. It is definitely one of the best places to travel in the Philippines\n\nWe had a couple days between scuba diving the shipwrecks of Coron Bay, and exploring El Nido, Palawan. We decided to spend it Island hopping in Coron with our friend Jette. We wanted to do the tour a little bit differently, so we organized a private boat for us three, and left an hour earlier than other boats. This paid off in the end, because these islands are getting very very busy, and we were able to miss most of the crowds. \n\n#FearlessandFar #Coron #Palawan #Philippines\n\nMy behind the scenes videos are here! https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nExploring with Cody:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/sircodybuffinton\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\nYou x You - Ooy\nShlow Motion Pt. 1 - Oomie\nLimitless - AGST\nWalk the Path - Digital Camel\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\nRarebeat - Fashion Beat\nSlow Motion Big Beat\n(www.AudioJungle.net)\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "Body Suspension. Just a quick warning that this extreme form of body piercing isn’t for everyone. This video has been edited to remove most of the most graphic scenes. If you’d like to see the full uncut version it will be available on my Patreon (www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar) very shortly. If you understand the disclaimer, and are ready to learn a bit more about human suspension, and why I would ever want to try it. Let’s continue.\n\nEach year I try and do something a little bit different for my birthday. I try and challenge myself. I try to explore beyond my boundaries. In past years I’ve gone bungee jumping, free diving, skydiving, lived solo in the woods, and this year. Body Suspension. The art of Hanging by Hooks. I thought I would make a short documentary about it.\n\nPiercing your body is painful, relying on your skin to support your body weight is even more painful, but that’s part of the process. It’s been called cathartic, life changing, and unexplainable. To the viewer, it’s shocking, to the practitioner, cathartic.\n\nWhile it might seem like a new trend, it’s been around for 5000 years. Shaivite Hindus used to tread the line of body and spirit through body suspension to pay penance to their god Shiva. Variations of this still happen today in various parts of the world. Thousands of years later in what is now known as North Dakota the North American Mandan Tribe would ritualistically hang themselves by hooks as a right of passage. It was how men became boys.\n\nTwo alternate cultures independently birthed this wild tradition without contact with each other.\n\nWe’re doing it again today. You see it at tattoo conventions, and street performances.  It makes me think there might be a bit more to it.\n\nIt’s my birthday, and I like to challenge myself on my birthday.

        "description": "La Tomatina Festival or The Tomato Fight in Spain is an amazing festival that happens in Bunol, near Valencia, at the end of every August. 11 trucks of tomatoes make their way into Buñol city square and a town of 9000 floods to 50 000+. This is La Tomatina, and it's the world's biggest food fight. \n\nSince it began hundreds of years ago, the festival as grown into a world wide phenomenon. You can see these tomato throwing fights in all corners of the world. Some more famous ones being in Glastonbury and Seattle.\n\nI hooked up with some friends on Couch Surfing and we took the train from Valencia to Bunol. At that time, it was packed. I can't beleive how many people are there now. I would recommend going the day before and booking accommodations far, far, in advance.\n\nIt's a helluva a party. Prepare to get soaked, stained, and pushed around. It was only an hour, which was a good thing. Being pelted by tomatoes is fun for about that amount of time, but not much after.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nSony Alpha a7S Digital Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony 16-35mm FE F4 ZA OSS: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 55mm F1.8 Sonnar T FE ZA: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nSony FE 90mm f/2.8-22 Macro G OSS: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\n\nRode VideoMic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nSanDisk Extreme PRO 64GB SD Card: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nPD Capture Camera Clip: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPD Capture Lens Kit: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPD slideLITE Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPD Rain Shell Cover: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\n3 Legged Thing Carbon Fiber Tripod:: http://geni.us/Tripod\nGlidecam HD-2000 Steadicam: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nDJI Phantom 3 4K Drone: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♫ Music: “_____\" - \n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here:\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------",

We caught this performance of Kecak, and traditional Balinese dance and Uluwatu (or Monkey) Temple. Over the years, it's changed a bit. Now part theatre, part fire, and part culture... It's quite a fun show.

        "description": "Mexico City street food is some of the best and tastiest around! Exploring with Cody and I found the Mexican specialty of chicharron in Chapultepec Park (Bosque de Chapultepec) and thought we should try it!\n\nHaving lived in Mexico City for almost a year, I had surprisingly not tried this Mexican snack, but I had seen it everywhere. Trying it is definitely one of the top things to do in Mexico\n\nThere are several different kinds of Chicharrón. Some made with flour, and others made the traditional way of deep frying pig fat.\n\nWe tried it 2 different ways. Chicharrón preparada, with avacado, tomato, cueritos, cream, cabbage, and salsas. Also Chicharrón solita, with just some sauces, Tajin, salt and Lime.\n\nAfter making this video, I learned that maybe we had made a mistake... Are both of these flour? Or is one actually the real one?\n\nI need to stop asking the shop keepers for information, I think they just answer \"Yes\" to every question so I buy their food 😐\n\nMexico is so much more than just tacos. There is god level street food here, allowing for some great food videos. Would you give this a taste test?\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nExploring with Cody https://www.youtube.com/user/SirCodyBuffinton\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a gift from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\nAll by Funky Fella\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

We didn't expect such an amazing experience, and we didn't expect much amazing support from Filipinos across the country. By popular demand, the Fighter Boys are back for a second trip!\n\nThis Philippines travel vlog kicks off on Camiguin Island to hike volcano Hibok-Hibok. Last time I was on Camiguin, we explored the Sunken Cemetery, and saw the Giant Clam Sanctuary. I didn't get a chance to visit White Island or hike the volcano. So... Bonus!\n\nA few things to note. Hibok-Hibok is closed right now. El Nido has made it too dry to safely summit without damaging the wildlife. Please check before you come.

        "description": "We made it. I've been wanting to visit this crazy festival in Spain for years. El Colacho, or the Baby Jumping Festival, has made almost every top 5 or top 10 strangest / weirdest festivals in the world internet list I can find. No where else on this planet can you see a grown man dressed as the devil jump over babies. It's unbelievable, and it all happens in the tiny town of Castrillo de Murcia.\n\nThe party itself is so much more than baby jumping, it's actually 4 days long, and the \"main event\" only the last hour on the last day. What happens is actually quite beautiful, and not as strange, weird, or crazy as you might think. There is a bit of a story line to the whole event, and what they think is that this festival was grandfathered in from before Christianity arrived in the area. It was adopted and modified to fit the new belief system, and here it still stands today.\n\nThe full name is El Salto de el Colacho, meaning \"The Jump of the Devil\", but there's more to the fiesta than that. It's a battle between good an evil. The townspeople pray to god, and the devil comes to interfere. The local children of the town mock him, and he chases them around with a whip. When the final prayers are said, the devil realizes he's lost the battle and flees from the cathedral. Babies are placed on mattresses in the streets, and the Original Sin (from Adam and Eve) and any diseases the babies might have stick to the devil during his retreat. It's like an elaborate baptism of the children. \n\nThere isn't much online about this amazing festival, so I'm hoping I got the information mostly right. Whether you agree or disagree with what happens here it's important to understand is that is local tradition, and for the parents and the children, one of the most important days of their lives. No child has even been hurt during this festival, and what we saw was extreme care, tenderness, and respect. Also the amount of smiling, laughing, and joy was contagious. While looking a bit crazy, reckless, and unbelievable on the outside, all we saw was beauty.\n\nHope you enjoyed El Colacho!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nMariannela Cataño\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n“Woman\" - Online Planet\n\"Spanish Fire\" - GarryOneal\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "This is the first episode of a new series here on Kick the Grind. It's going to be called travel stories, and I'll be explaining some of the wild adventures behind the videos you see here.\n\nThis was all filmed in and around Leticia, Colombia. This part of the country is right on the border between Brazil, and Peru. Here many people take river cruises to the Peruvian Amazon, or wander off into the depths of Brazilian amazon in search for a Shaman.\n\nKicking it off, is answering the number 1 question I had after posting the amazon jungle adventure challenge videos, and then the experience finding a shaman in the Brazilian rainforest.\n\nIn this video I explain a bit more of what happened in the forests of South America, and also explain our encounter with Huito, a seed that creates a blue pigment when mixed with water. It's also called Jagua Tattooing when you use this deep colour to stain your hair, skin, hands, etc. We encountered this strange plant many times while doing our river cruise, and began to apply it shortly after fishing for piranhas. When your Jagua Tattoo is first applied it looks clear. Fast forward a day later, and it looks like you have crazy full hand tattoos. \n\nWe also were painted with Annatto, also known as Achiote or Colorau. It's an orange pigment from the seed of a tree. These seeds produce a bright orange paste that is used to paint ornamental markings on the skin. It is also used as a food colorant in many dishes (and processed foods) around the world.\n\nIf you want make it on the hand, just like the video, leave me a nice comment, and end it with the motto \"Experiences over Possessions\"\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\nLarge Minority Adventure Holidays: https://www.largeminority.travel/\n\nCaspar Diederik: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7B7roL_ru8QS2NK8Yf4vjg\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Happiness\" - Funky Fella\n\"Have Some Love\" - Funky Fella\n\n\"Hitchhikers guide\" - Niklas Ahlström\n\"Jungle Walking\" - Tomas Skyldeberg\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nPHOTOS USED:\n\nColorau seeds: Leonardo Ré-Jorge\n\nHuito Flower: João Medeiros\n\nHuito Fruit: Alex Popovkin, Bahia, Brazil\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "The battle of the oranges in Ivrea, Italy is one of the biggest food fights in the world. Known as Battaglia delle Arance, or Storico Carnevale Ivrea in Italy, this festival is easily one of the most exciting, and was it's biggest celebration yet in 2019. It is the only orange battle in the world.\n\nOften compared to the tomato fight in Buñol, Spain near Valencia. La Tomatina is a very different experience. Tomatoes are a joke compared to oranges. If you've been to La Tomatina before, expect a much more extreme festival. \n\nTeams like Scacchi, Picche, Arduini, Tuchini, Diavoli, Pantera Nera, Mercenari, Credendari, Morte, team up in the 5 town squares in Ivrea over 3 days of Battle. While the festival seems to be all about oranges, it's much deeper than that and has a complex and rich history around it. Ivrea, Italia is located just outside of Turino (Torino) and not that far from Milan.\n\nThe say it started this way. In medieval times there was an evil king who enforced Ius Primae Noctis, aka \"Prima Nocta\" on all the new brides. This \"rule\" meant that the king got to deflower every woman before her husband on her wedding night. The Miller's Daughter called The Mugnaia, was brought to his quarters on her wedding night for this terrible act. She courageously grabbed his sword, and cut off his head. She freed herself, and the people of Ivrea from his tyranny. This carnival is a celebration of freedom, not citrus fruit.\n\nIf you'd like to attend the Battle of the Oranges next year. I've made a guide to help you understand how to experience it.

        "description": "Seen on Ghost Hunters, Ghost Adventures, and many other shows about the scariest places in the world. The terror of this location has stretched across the planet. The story is much more than an island of Mexican Dolls. Isla de las Munecas, or Island of the Dolls is one of the top 10 most haunted places in the country, and is found just south of Mexico City in an area called Xochimilco. \n\nI hit up my friends Exploring with Josh Exploring with Cody to help me check out this urban legend. Awesome dudes. Also my GF Mariannela helped us out a lot with this. Make sure to check out their links below!\n\nJulian Santana, the creator moved here in the mid 1900s because of heartbreak. He desired to just be alone, he didn't any intention on creating one of the most haunted places in Mexico. Upon arriving he witnessed a girl fall into the river and drown. That night, he heard horrible screams, and believed the ghost of the girl had come to haunt him. He began hanging dolls from trees to keep her spirit happy, he did this for several decades before dying of a heart attack in the exact same place the girl had died. Creepy, I know.\n\nThere are lots of things to do in this area of CDMX (or DF), but the main attraction is taking the colourful trajineras for a spin around the chiampas. This probably sounds pretty fancy, but basically it means jumping on a colourful boat, sitting and drinking beer while Mariachi bands pass by. You'd never expect one of the scariest places in Mexico is just around the corner, covered in decapitated dolls, spider webs, and ghost stories.\n\nThis was the 4th time I had ventured down to Xochimilco to find doll island. There are a few issues with the adventure if you speak english.\nThere are three ports you can leave from, make sure you go to EMBARCADERO CUEMANCO, the other two are full of scammers (at least from my experience). Also, keep in mind there are two Isla de las Muñecas. One is a replica, and I believe they built it because the original is much further from the launch point, and pushing a 10m boat through canals for 2 hours each way is a pain.\n\nIf you're a fan of horror or paranormal activity, this will be an experience for you. Just make sure not to get fooled!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nExploring with Josh: https://www.youtube.com/user/theartofrealitycrew\n\nExploring with Cody:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/SirCodyBuffinton\n\nMariannela Cataño:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music: “Toy Ballet\" - Baton\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here:\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Welcome to one of the coolest homes I've ever stayed in. We first came across this place on Airbnb, and couldn't believe something so amazing was so close to Mexico City. It is a series of 10 apartments build into the back of a giant serpent. It's the coolest house I've ever seen, if you don't mind living in a snake god.\n\nIt was created by Javier Senosiain, a Mexican architect specializing in Organic Architecture. This philosophy of construction blends   seamlessly with nature, so they both work together in harmony. This location is called El Nido de Quetzalcoatl (The Nest of Quetzalcoatl) because of the giant snake head that is the centre piece of the location. When Javier first decided to build the park, he came across a giant cave whose opening resembled the gaping mouth of a snake. This inspired him to continue the theme, and great a giant 18 hectare park, with 13 snakes twisting through it. Despite everything he has created here, the valley in which everything is hidden, is vastly untouched. His constructions are guided using the natural shape of the land. \n\nAs far as things to do in Mexico, this is an absolute must. I have never seen anything like this in all of my years as a travel vlogger. It is truly an oasis hidden away in Naucalpan, just outside Mexico City.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nTO VISIT:\n\nAt this time you have two options. A private tour or staying in the apartment. Our contact for both of these is Patricia. Her email: mopacastillo(at)gmail.com\n\nThe easiest, and which that allows you the most freedom is to stay there overnight. It is a 10 person apartment, with a recommended minimum of 2 nights. This can sometimes be negotiated depending on the time of year. Get some friends together and split the cost. It is worth it.\n\nThe Airbnb Listing is here: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10153978\n\nIf you don't have an Airbnb account, you can my link to get $35 off your first booking: www.airbnb.com/c/mcorey24\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a gift from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nCheck out Mariannela!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Carillon Dancer\" - Marco Belloni\n\"Focus\" - OGROD\n\"Hers\" - OGROD\n\"Tone\" - OGROD\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "We made a mistake.\nIn this Pakistan Travel Vlog, we arrive in a beautiful little town in Skardu. After seeing so many smiling faces, I decided to have a little fun. There was a small place making naan bread, we took one to make a mask to make the locals laugh. This had the opposite effect. They all seemed quite offended that I had used bread this way. I learned later bread was sacred. I had taken my love of capturing people's smiles a little too far.\n\nWe continue on and have some of the most beautiful encounters with locals I have ever had. You can tell by all the portrait shots. It was one of the friendliest places I have ever been.\n\nAfter visiting Fairy Meadows, Hunza Valley, Nanga Parbat, the Karakoram Highway, and all out other adventures, this was a nice way to continue of Pakistan Travel Vlog series\n\nPakistan tourism is on the rise. It's often called a dangerous place to travel. Our purpose was to spend our time, as foreigners in Pakistan to disprove this, and show the beauty of the people and the landscape to the world. CPIC Global sponsored out trip, but we did so without any security or military escorts. The only trouble we got into was bumpy roads.\n\nWhile normally I solo travel, I was excited to have so many friends on the trip.

        "description": "Here's a tip... don't film in a strip club or brothel in Bangkok Thailand. In fact, maybe avoid filming anything in Patpong, the red light district. This was a rookie mistake a made several years ago while under pressure for a TV casting in South East Asia. I thought I would share the experience, dig an old travel video out out of my hard drive, and tell you the story of the most scared I've been in 8 years of travelling the world. \n\nPatpong night life and street markets area a integral part of the things to do in Bangkok. While it is the red light area of Bangkok, it's not particularly dangerous for the average tourist. There is all sorts of strange things to see however... You can buy tazers, see ping pong ball shows, and visit Gogo Bars. Drink cheap beer, find great streetfood, and get a neck massage while you pee at a urinal (this really happened, and was quite a surprise). It's open late, and can be quite a crazy (but fun) experience for people visiting the city.\n\nThis particular night I visited the area a bit beyond the scope of a normal tourist. I was out in the streets trying to compete with locals at 3am to prove myself for a casting call. I did not plan on going anywhere near a stripclub, or Patpong, that night. Fate had something different in store for me, and I was desperate. The lesson learned was don't ever film in the red light district of Bangkok Thailand.\n\n \nHere's the original video I had sent for the casting of the TV, I have re-uploaded it to YouTube as unlisted if anyone wants to see 🤣 https://youtu.be/93noljDSEz8\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a gift from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nNot Bulsoon.

        "description": "Angel Falls aka Salto Angel in Canaima National Park is the highest waterfall in the world!\n\nIn this second episode of our Venezuela 2019 travel vlog, we continue our adventures South America at Canaima National Park. \nFor both Lexie and I, visiting Angel Falls was always a travel goal. With the current mess with Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuela crisis hitting a peak in the news, and the massive drop in tourism, we thought we would have to put it off indefinitely. \nFortunately we had great contacts (Pablo and Sandy), who made this dream trip possible for us. So we flew into Caracas, and the story begins. They say \"Don't blame a country by the actions of its government\" So we couldn't believe all the bad Venezuela news, we wanted to meet the people, and see its nature and landscape.\n\nThe day started with a 3 hour boat ride up Rio Carrao, with a stop at La Poza de Felicidad, or Happiness Pool. When we got to our campsite, we found it abandoned. Angels Falls used to get 500+ tourists a day, and now it was receiving what looked like it's first 2 in a long time. We set up our hammocks and begun to explore. We found a crack in the jungle, and bam... There it was Angel Falls, the highest waterfall in the world, peeking out between the trees.\n\nThe next morning we started early and hiked an hour to a viewpoint and pool at the base of the falls. We even managed to get drone video of angel falls. It was the perfect travel day.\n\nOur hearts go out the the Venezuelan people. Myself and my travel companion Lexie Alford visited this beautiful place late 2018, with the mission to show another side of a country in crisis. We planned to show the beauty of the people, and the natural beauty of the country.\n\nThis is not a video about the current economical or political situation. This is a Venezeula travel vlog of what we experienced as tourists. \n\n#FearlessandFar #Venezuela #Angelfalls\n\nWant more videos?

This travel vlog is episode 4 of our experience as tourists in a country in a pressure cooker.\n\nThe Venezuela Crisis has been in the spotlight for quite some time now, and with an invite from a local friend Sandy, we set out to explore this beautiful country despite what it had been saying in the news.\n\nWhat we found was an incredible country which took our hearts.\n\nWe begin this episode landing back in Puerto Ordaz from seeing Angel Falls in Canaima National Park. From there, my Canadian friend Sandy, who has been living in Venezuela for over 3 years, picks us up for a roadtrip.\n\nWe drive 4 hours north to the town he is living in called Lecheria, near Barcelona, Venezuela. We then go island hopping to visit Isla Faro, and that's where we encounter our first run in with trouble... Cacti and Snakes.\n\nThe outro of this video was re-recorded after the incident when humanitarian aid was stopped by Maduro at the border between Venezuela and Colombia. \n\nOur hearts go out the the Venezuelan people. Myself and my travel companion Lexie Alford visited this beautiful place late 2018, with the mission to show another side of a country in crisis. We planned to show the beauty of the people, and the natural beauty of the country.\n\nThis is not a video about the current economical or political situation. This is a Venezeula travel vlog of what we experienced as tourists. \n\n#FearlessandFar #Venezuela #Travel\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nJoin the Adventure Newsletter\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/join-our-adventure-newsletter\n\n5 Advanced Travel Tips I Wish I Knew When I Started\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/5-advanced-travel-tips-i-wish-i-knew-when-i-started\n\nEXPERIENCES OVER POSSESSIONS SHIRTS\nhttps://shop.fearlessandfar.com/\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nCheck out Lexie's Venezuela Blog Posts\n\nHow we did it:\nhttp://living-lost.com/2018/10/31/getting-there-angel-falls-venezuela-2018/\n\nAlso her Instagram @lexielimitless\n\nBig love to our trip organizer Pablo Martínez and my awesome friend Sandy Corey for helping us put this all together.

        "description": "Rooftopping is the art of climbing sky scrapers. We're in Caracas, Venezuela to put it all on the edge and climb 2 of it's tallest towers. The first will be the notorious Torre David. A 45-story building that was never finished because of a financial crisis in the 1990s. Squatters moved in and turned it into a home for thousands of people. It became a symbol of Venezuela’s struggles and the people's ability to create their own community.\n\nParque Central is a complex of 5 towers with the tallest tower standing 56 stories high. It was built as a major residential and commercial center. The taller tower became a symbol of modern urban development in Venezuela but also faced challenges like fires and economic decline over the years. The east tower is abandoned from halfway up.\n\nWANT TO VISIT VENEZUELA? Message @furia-tv  on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/vidafuria\n\nBig love my boy Fplus a famous rooftopper in Caracas.

        "description": "The Hussaini hanging bridge in Hunza Valley Pakistan is known as one of the most dangerous in the world. In this travel vlog, we walk across it (carefully) and talk to some local Pakistani people along the way.\n\nIn the small town of Passu Cones, in the Gojal region of Northern Pakistan lies a suspension bridge unlike any other. Built by local farmers, the purpose of the bridge over the Hunza river is to keep their livestock away from their crops. I'm not sure if it's by design that this bridge has more empty space than wood, but it takes some serious nerves to walk across it. \n\nNo safety harnesses, no guidance. It's become a bit of a tourist attraction for people traveling through the Hunza valley in Gilgit Baltistan. It's a suspension bridge attached by cables bolted into the towering mountains on either side. It's a adventure I recommend to everyone, just watch your step.\n\nPakistan tourism is on the rise. It's often called a dangerous place to travel. Our purpose was to spend our time, as foreigners in Pakistan to disprove this, and show the beauty of the people and the landscape to the world. CPIC Global sponsored out trip, but we did so without any security or military escorts. The only trouble we got into was bumpy roads.\n\nWhile normally I solo travel, I was excited to have so many friends on the trip.

Let's quote Anthony Bourdain first “Do we really want to travel in hermetically sealed pope mobiles through the rural provinces of France, Mexico and the Far East, eating only in Hard Rock Cafes and McDonalds? Or do we want to eat without fear, tearing into the local stew, the humble taqueria’s mystery meat, the sincerely offered gift of a lightly grilled fish head? I know what I want. I want it all.

In this Philippines travel vlog we explore more of the island of Basilan in Mindanao Philippines. \n\nDuring day 1 part two I horribly lose a dunk competition to a bunch of locals in Maluso, we find paradise on Langgas Island, and I sit down and talk about what the first day was actually like. \n\nThis small island has had a lot of trouble in the past. Muslim extremist groups have damaged its people and its reputation. As a foreigner in the Philippines, everyone told me to stay away from the south. Mindanao was \"dangerous\" and \"no one should go\", is what I was told by both filipinos and foreign travelers. After the Mindanao roadtrip with the Fighterboys, I would have to disagree. Love and generosity is what we experienced, an appreciation from the people that I have rarely felt while travelling the world. We met the governor of ARMM, our local contact (always have a local contact) and spent 4 days here. While I wouldn't recommend travelling here on your first day in the Philippines, \n\nThis is Day 1 Part 2 of exploring Basilan Mindano Philippines.\n\n#FearlessandFar #Basilan #Mindanao\n\nI post wild stories and travel tips here: https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nFind Kulas here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Jennermann\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "On the western tip of Holbox Island, just a few hours from Cancun, is a beautiful beach called Punta Cocos. This beach is one of the most photographed around Cancun during sunset because it is facing west (rare for a beach in Riviera Maya), and also is home to the beach hammocks that make for great silhouette pictures.\n\nLong after the sun sets, this beach still remains popular, not for parties, but for another attraction entirely; Bioluminescence. It becomes a glowing beach, and it's amazing to see.\n\nBioluminescent plankton are found here in one of the highest concentrations in Mexico. The water is very shallow, and even 20 meters or so away from shore, it's still below your knees. This allows these little glowing animals go accumulate in large numbers during the summer.\n\nWe visited in May, but were told the best season to see this phenomenon was in July or August after they have had a couple months of summer heat to reproduce. It is really incredible to see. These animals use light to scare away predators. In the ocean, there's usually always something bigger that can eat you, and by lighting up whoever is trying to eat them, they can attract an even larger fish to scare their attacker away. \n\nThere are lots of beautiful islands around the Yucatan peninsula, Cozumel, Isla Mujeres, But Isla Holbox, is just beginning to get popular. Come visit now, or preferably in July or August, and see one of the best light shows in Mexico.\n\nMany of the locations I feature on this channel are undiscovered. If you go, remember to take care of these places. Respect the animals and people who live there, don't throw your trash, and have a great time.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n “Minimalism\" - Fugu Vibes\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "The landings and take offs at the Saint Martin Airport or Sint Maarten Airport in the Caribbean are really close to the shore. It's called SXM or Julian, and it has it's roots as a military base. You'd never build and airport this close to a road under normal circumstances. Right beside the landing strip is Maho Beach. Here you can get blasted by the Boeing 747 jet and Large Airbus and other planes as they land and take off. \n\nParticularly seeing the large KLM planes landing just a few meters overhead is wild. We didn't feel like we were in danger, but there are many signs saying it's dangerous to stand next to the fence. For us, that was half the fun. It's kind of funny to watch all the Bros and Bikini girls on the beach fleeing from the amount of sand and rocks shot back onto the beach with everyone sunbathing.

It's primarily done by Buddhist monks in Cambodia and Thailand. They truly believe that these enchantments can do everything from deflecting bullets to protecting your farm from mice. \n\nIt's pretty common to see Muy Thai fighters with Yantra Tattoos on their backs. If you take a close look a many thai amulets, the designs are the same.

        "description": "It's about time I show you what's in my backpack. In over 100 videos we have never spoken about cameras.\n\nI did this on purpose, as it's not the camera that makes the vlogger, it's the vlogger that makes the camera (that doesn't make any sense). What I mean is... Give any professional travel vlogger a smart phone and an internet connection and they could make an successful channel. \n\nThat being said, knowing the best cameras, and the best lenses for what you're trying to do IS important. Once you understand the basics of travel vlogging or travel filmmaking, you can maximize your creativity by getting the right camera equipment. \n\nI've been filming my travels for about 6 years, and the first 4 were spent on big budget projects. These were just myself, or a small team of people. I begun to focus on this YouTube channel, and during this whole adventure, have tried a lot of brands and models of cameras, lenses, drones, backpacks, etc. I've realized the most important thing when shooting travel videos is \nminimizing down time (switching lenses, unzipping pouches, screwing on filters). It doesn't matter what you're shooting with if you miss the shot. \n\nI'm confident that with this set up, you are ready for just about anything. You spend very little time messing around with gear, and much more time being ready to capture the moment\n\nEfficiency and effectiveness are the most important parts of a camera kit. The problem is that most people forget to pack those.

        "description": "In this Philippines Travel vlog we visit Samar and try this wild new filipino tourist attraction, torpedo boat rides!\n\nThese tippy boats were once used for the illegal logging industry in the Philippines. About a decade ago, the idea was presented to the local community to use them for tourism instead, it would be better for the environment, and more lucrative.\n\nNow you can jump in one of these water rockets, get soaked, narrowly miss rocks, and fly through rapids. It's quite a ride!\n\nLast year I travelled for 3 months as a foreigner in the Philippines before concluding my filipino travel vlog series with the Fighter Boys trip with Kyle Jennermann of Becoming Filipino, Daniel Marsh, Finn Snow, Bret Maverick. Nicknamed the Fighter Boys, after our sponsor Fighter Wine. \n\nHope you enjoyed this wild video!

While doing so, we encountered an abandoned military barracks. I had heard a lot about the abandoned Soviet Military Bases in eastern Europe, and even went urban exploring a military bunker once, but nothing like this. \n\nAfter we returned to the camp, and caught fresh seafood with our hands, made a pasta, and drank around a campfire.

This is a train journey of 10,000 km across Russia, the biggest country in the world. 25 days to visit Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Krasnoyarsk, Ulan-Ude, and Vladivostok. \n\nA big thank you to the sponsors of the #TransSibChallenge\n- Russian Geographical Organization - https://www.rgo.ru/en\n- Svoya Tropa Russia Tour Operator - https://svoya-tropa.com/ \n\nEXPERIENCES OVER POSSESSIONS SHIRTS\nhttps://shop.fearlessandfar.com/\n\n#FearlessandFar #Russia #TransSibChallenge\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\nFRIENDS FEATURED\n\nGARETH https://www.youtube.com/tourist2townie\nRUBEN - https://www.youtube.com/ChannelLetsGo\nYAROSLAV - If you're interested in anything we did on this trip, contact Yaroslav.

There a quite a few haunted places I had my eye on to check out, so I called up my friends Exploring with Josh and Exploring with Cody. Urban exploration is pretty new for me, I started sneaking into creepy places just about a year ago, and now I'm hooked.\n\nPosada del Sol is over 100 years old. It's original owner and founder was an architect, and the detail he put into creating this hotel was incredible. He wanted to make the most beautiful hotel in the country, and he did... you have to see this place to believe it.\n\nThe hotel in CDMX was only open for 8 months, before closing. Rumours of a girl dying in the basement, family members killing them selves, and political issues with the Freemasons forced it's closure. After it became abandoned, Negro Durazo an infamously corrupt police chief tortured people in the basement.\n\nNow, this abandoned building is a treasure trove for urban exploration, and paranormal activity . It looks like a set from a movie. Ivy twisting up the cracked walls, crumbling statues of saints, murals chipping away on the walls.\n\nThis was a special adventure, a creepy one, I hope you like a bit of horror, because that's exactly what this adventure was. I shot most of it on my new Gimbal the Zhiyun-Tech Crane. \n\nYou can check it out here: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\n\nEnjoy!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nMy Steadicam to keep things Balanced: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music: “Lost in Depression\" - Mayelnoizes\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here:\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­———————",

        "description": "https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\nThere are a couple places in the world where you can see Rainbow Mountains. Rainbow Mountain in Peru is a tough hike at over 4000m, and also the Zhangye Danxia Landform Geological Park in China. There is something a little bit similar, and my first day in the Philippines lead me to this strange place. \n\nIn this travel Philippines vlog, we head 12h north of Manila to Sagada. Home of the hanging coffins, Marlboro Country and Blue Soil Hills.\n\nIf you're a fan of beautiful nature, adventure, or seeing strange places, the blue soil hills and Marlboro County sunrise hike are epic.\n\nMost people head to Kiltepan for sunrise. Don't do that. Instead book this hike. I was one of only a few people there. Sunrise at Kiltepan is PACKED. After seeing this amazing show, you hike another 2 hours to Blue Soil Hills.\n\nErosion has revealed a section of crumbling blue stone in the forest. Copper is responsible for this phenomenon. The copper in the soil reacts with the air and develops a patina. The fancy word for the green/blue coating you see on copper pennies or church roofs. This gives the soil a very unique appearance! You need to visit this place!\n\nIf you're filipina or filipino, let me know where I should go next.

        "description": "Along the coast of Riviera Maya in Mexico, there are hundreds of resorts. Xpu ha beach club (or Xpu-Há) is a very popular \"off the beaten path\" spot for tourists to go to get away from the craziness of Cancun, Playa del Carmen, and Tulum... because of this, the place has become a bit of a tourist trap itself. \n\nIn 2005, Hurricane Wilma, a category 5 monster destroyed much of Caribbean coast. 12 years later, you can still see the remains of resorts that were not rebuilt. Xpu-Ha Palace was one of those places. \n\nSome interesting features of this particular Riviera Maya resort was it's natural coral lagoon, which connected underground to a beautiful cenote which sat in the middle of the resort. This made it easily one of the most beautiful places to stay in Mexico, especially on this coast.\n\nNow, there is a surprising amount of it still standing. Much of the wooden structures have fallen, but the shell of the resort still remains, and is just a 20 minute walk down the beach from Xpu-Ha Beach.\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a gift from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nMariannela Catano \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Recovery Abstract\" - Brilliance Audio\n\n\"Twoj\" - OGROD\n\"Violet\" - OGROD\nhttps://soundcloud.com/maciejkulesza\n\n\"Funky Gringo\" - Funky Fella\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Today we're buying 10,000 Bananas...\nWe've been travelling in Bangladesh for a week, cooking up one of the most interesting projects yet. While searching for Dhaka street food, we came across Karwan Bazaar, a large market in Dhaka with just about everything, Including a whole lot of Bananas.\n\nIn Bangladesh over 6 million kids wake up hungry, so we all came together to make a travel vlog with a purpose: raise enough money to buy 10,000 bananas for hungry kids in Bangladesh. To make this happen, I opened a GoFundMe, and reached out to Thrive, a local NGO specializing in delivering food to schools. We raised enough money for 18,800 bananas and this video is about delivering a few thousand of them to schools.\n\nSo, to address a few things here in the description. In total, we raised about 1,600 USD (including my personal donation to purchase bananas on the shoot day) They are about 3 cents per banana without shipping and delivery. For this video, we factored that in to our final sum. The shelf life of Bananas is only a few days, so we bought about 10,000 on that day, and the rest will be purchased later in the week so nothing gets spoiled. Cool? Cool!\n\nTogether we did this!

I moved here 2 months ago a noticed a huge abandoned building close to my house. It's a towering 17 stories, and it's crumbling concrete and smashed windows seem out of place in one of the best neighbourhoods in the city. \n\nUrban Exploration is something I can't get enough of, so I started to ask questions. The story was much more complicated and interesting than I thought. It was so much more can just an abandoned apartment building. It was quite famous in CDMX,  I had also seen a post by Vice Mexico about it in Spanish. I wanted to solve the mystery.\n\nInsurgentes 300 is it's name. That comes from the name of the busy street it's located on, and also it's number on that street. This 500 room tower was built to be the biggest and most beautiful Condo in Latin America. Housing Doctors, Lawyers, and people of high class. In 1985, and earthquake of unprecedented magnitude rocked the city, toppling many building very similar to Insurgentes 300, thousands of people were trapped under the rubble. Our famous tower did not fall.\n\nUnfortunately, it's foundation was badly damaged. The Mexican Government deemed it unsafe, it was evacuated, and condemned. No one was allowed to live there any longer.\n\nSeizing the opportunity for free housing in a busy part of town, the filth of Mexico City ruled this abandoned building for the 30 years. Drug Dealers, Mafia, Criminals infested the building until very recently.  Scary People. The word was that it was more dangerous inside the building, than out. The Police entered and purged the place only 4 years ago. \n\nNow a brave group have begun renovating the building, floor by floor, trying to repair it enough to have the ban lifted. They want to return it to it's former glory. It will be a lot of work, and it will be a war to have the ban lifted.\n\nI called up my friends Exploring with Josh and Exploring with Cody. We spoke to the caretakers, and they allowed us in for a tour. It was an amazing experience. We did our best to capture it. These are the reasons I travel.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nMy Steadicam to keep things Balanced: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music: \n“Suspense\" - Santile\n\"Dead City\" - MarioLucianAndreano\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here:\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "SCUBA diving in Belize in a highlight of both the Caribbean and tourism in Central America. While the jungles attract a lot of tourists, Belize is also home to the second largest barrier reef in the world. It has so many incredible experiences for those who love to dive or snorkel. For this SCUBA diving adventure travel vlog I teamed up with PADI, a world famous diver training organization, and William Drumm, a talented underwater photographer. \n\nWe started the trip by taking a small plane from Belize City to San Pedro in Ambergris Caye. Here, we met up with Ramon's Village Resort and dove Hol Chan Marine Park, as well as many of the beautiful coral channels that snake through the reef. Highlights here for us were Nurse Sharks, Loggerhead Sea Turtles, and even an Octopus\n\nUnfortunately our dive to The Great Blue Hole was cancelled due to weather, but ended up seeing a Bottlenose dolphin underwater close to the reef. Not a bad replacement.\n\nNext was taking another plane from San Pedro to Placencia to meet Patricia at SPLASH dive centre to dive at Silk Caye. We island hopped, saw the underwater goddess statue, and trekked through Cockscomb Basin.\n\nHope you Enjoyed this SCUBA diving travel vlog in Belize!\n\nFor my Behind the Scenes Content: https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n#Fearlessandfar #Belize #SCUBA \n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nGet SCUBA Certified with PADI\nhttps://www.padi.com/\n\nWilliam Drumm is the man with the camera!\nhttps://www.instagram.com/williamdrumm\n\nSplash Dive Centre in Placencia\nhttp://www.splashbelize.com/\n\nRamon's Village Resort\nhttp://ramons.com/\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ ambergris travel vlog tourism",

        "description": "And the gold medal of 2017 goes to! \nVisiting the Firefly sanctuary near Nanacamilpa, Tlaxcala, Mexico was completely unbelievable. Thousands of them, and spinning and swirling around us and into the tree tops. Lighting up IN SYNC with each other like a coordinated light show. It didn't feel like planet earth, it felt like I stood up to fast and was seeing stars, it felt like I stepped into fantasy.\n\nI drove 2 hours to stay at the eco lodge Piedra Canteada, deep in the pine forests of Oyamel. These insects show their faces for just a month every year to breed. This story might sound a little bit like the Monarch Butterfly Migration that we saw earlier in the year, but instead of flying from Canada, the fireflies are here all year round; you just can't see them.\n\nThe firefly we know, isn't even a fly, it's a beetle. All beetles have a larval stage called a grub, and fireflies live in the dirt without wings for 20 months before erupting out of a pupae (a bit like a cocoon) for one single month to have a giant sex party.\n\nThis show is easily one of the top 5 most amazing natural phenomena I have seen so far in my travels, and I can't believe it's not more popular. Bioluminescence continues to blow my mind. Glowing plankton, fireflies, mushrooms... I think it is incredible.\n\nEnjoy this quick video of the Firefly Sanctuary in Tlaxcala, I don't think anyone has filmed it yet on Youtube. I needed special equipment, and It was a bit tricky to capture this for you guys.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\nTlaxcala helped me out a lot to be able to capture this.

        "description": "This is one of Mexico's best kept secrets!\nAn abandoned church in the middle of a volcanic rock field. 60 years ago a whole town was destroyed by this volcano, and now just the church remains. A total adventure, and an explorer's dream. I teamed up with my urbex vlogging friends Exploring with Josh and Exploring with Cody to discover this amazing tourist attraction in Michoacan, Mexico. It was easily one of the most unbelievable locations I've visited in 2017. If you travel, it has to go on your bucket list.\n \nLa ciudad de San Juan and Volcan Paricutin have an amazing story.\nIn 1943 a crack opened up in a farmer's field, little did they know that a phenomenon brand new to science was about to be born. I'm no expert, but it's safe to say there have been hundreds of thousands of volcanos erupt while humans walked on two feet. This volcano however, was special. No volcano had ever been studied from birth to death. Every previous volcano had erupted some time in the past, formed a mountain, went dormant, then re-erupted. Volcán Parícutin attracted scientists from around the world.\n\nBesides the fact that exploring this place was amazing... being able to climb onto the towers (a bit scary), and get into the basement Altar... We had it to ourselves for 4 hours. There was no admission fee, there were no tourists. At the end a school group came, but that was it. It really felt like a genuine experience. This place should be much more famous.\n\nNot featured in this video was the town of Angahuan, the launching point to see the volcano and the church. There, they speak Purepecha, not spanish. Also, there are loud speakers that blast prayers during the day. A very unique experience in Mexico.\n\nAlways happy to explore with Josh and Cody.

        "description": "Top 10 Philippines Locations on Trover: http://bit.ly/Philippines_Secret_Locations\n\nAfter travelling as a foreigner in the Philippines for many months, I've been all over the country making travel vlogs. It really is a dream destination, but there's so much more to see than the beaches!\n\nWhile I have been island hopping in Coron to visit kayangan lake, twin lagoon, and nacpan beach by el nido in Palawan. My mission was always to find what else was there.\n\nI've avoided places like Siargao and Boracay. I'm sure they are some of the most beautiful places in the Philippines, but I've always felt they were not the best places to se Filipino culture.\n\nThis is a sort of Travel Guide for the Philippines. For people who like to get off the beaten path, and love adventure travel. \n\nThese are my top 10 favourite destinations in the Philippines so far.\n\n1. Apo Whang-Od \nThe last mambabatok doing traditional Kalinga tattoos. Shes 102 years old and a legend in the Philippines. https://youtu.be/Ivn4-GzrETM\n\n2. Blue Soil Hills\nThe rainbow mountain of the Philippines. There is blue soil just outside of Sagada in Northern Luzon. It's incredible to see. https://youtu.be/h1rfNMyUG0Q\n\n3. The Hanging Coffins\nEcho Valley is a very famous place to see the Hanging coffins. There are many better places however, you just have to ask.\nhttps://youtu.be/p9vyz_HYKZM\n\n4. The Sunken Cemetery\nJust off the coast of Camiguin island there is a Giant Cross standing out in the ocean. Surrounding it is a cemetery sunk by a volcano. Only in the Philippines... https://youtu.be/lPCnUCvh-pg\n\n5. Warship Graveyard of Coron\nWhile many go island hopping in Coron, there is another adventure under the waves. Giant Japanese warships are sunk, and ready to explore for advanced Scuba Divers.\nhttps://youtu.be/ZVa1bOwyprA\n\n6. Britania Islands\nJust below Siargao in Mindanao, in Surigao del Sur, you can find these magnificent islands. Very few people venture this far. https://youtu.be/CgyE2DyVppg\n\n7. Matigol Falls\nEasily one of the most amazing waterfalls in the Philippines, and unknown to tourism outside of Mindanao. This waterfall was \"The one that got away\" https://youtu.be/FDre4ptJPiU\n\n8. Bulingan Falls\nA stepping stone Columnar Basalt waterfall on Basilan, Mindanao. There can't be very many of these on planet earth. https://youtu.be/A8UANZdETHU\n\n9. Torpedo Boats\nIllegal logging boats are now being used to shoot thrill seeking tourists up rivers in Northen Samar.\nhttps://youtu.be/K03sxDaJSHU\n\n10. Filipino Food.\nFood in the Philippines has a bad repuatation. Most of it is quite tasty, even if it doesn't appeal to the western Palette. Especially the street food! https://youtu.be/PVEeScXdSVU\n\nI hope you enjoyed this video!

This makes the island hopping experience here in Raja Ampat some of the best in the world as well.\n\nIn this vlog we hike up to the top of the Piaynemo view point, race back down to get a shot in the lagoon, have lunch with sharks, and then end up at a Rainy Batu Pencil to end the day.\n\nBig love to Wonderful Indonesia for hosting this trip!\nThis was part of the #TripOfWonders, and annual influencer trip where creators get together and explore Wonderful Indonesia\n\n#FearlessandFar #Tripofwonders #RajaAmpat\n\nMy Behind the scenes content -https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nCheck out Wonderful Indonesia here: https://www.indonesia.travel/\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

After a traumatic experience when she was younger, she has a phobia of being adrift in the open ocean. This is called Thalassophobia, and it's very common.\n\nI connect with Yahya, a Master Freediving instructor in Muscat, Oman. Through his dive shop, Divers Planet, he agrees to teach Eva how to Freedive. The art of apnea; breath holding underwater.\n\nOver the course of a week, we slowly re-introduce Eva to the Open Ocean again, in a fun and more informed way. Will she conquer her fear and become a mermaid? Or disappear forever in the deep blue ocean... (She's still here) But did she succeed?\n\n@Eva Zu Beck's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/evazubeckofficial\n\nDivers Planet Muscat: https://www.facebook.com/Diversplanetstore.center/\n\n#FearlessandFar #Oman #Freediving\n\nTHE FEAR WORKSHEET: \nhttps://www.fearlessandfar.com/fear\n\nBEHIND THE SCENES HERE:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\nEXPERIENCES OVER POSSESSIONS SHIRTS\nhttps://shop.fearlessandfar.com/\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\nThe BEST place for music.

        "description": "In this Philippines travel vlog, I team up with Becoming Filipino to take on a strange Filipino street food in Bankerohan Public Market, Davao City, Mindanao.\n\nBeing a foreigner in the Philippines, Bulcachong took me a bit by surprise. It's a specialty in Davao City, and you can definitely see why. It's a unique street food, and quite interesting to look at. Perfect for a travel vlogger who likes adventurous eating.\n\nMade from Water Buffalo or Beef, this soup is actually pretty tasty. The meat is boiled for 4 or 5 hours until (mostly) tender. However the meat wasn't exactly what I was used to. Even after 2 months of eating and making travel vlogs of street food in the Philippines I had not seen anything like it before. Even in my entire career as a travel YouTuber, I have not seen this part of the animal before.\n\nSome was identifiable, some wasn't, a few bits were tender, most was chewy, but either way... this soup was delicious. I still don't know what half of the animal parts were but it doesn't matter. I would 100% have it again! And I would 100% recommend Davao City travel as well. Mindanao is amazing.\n\n#FearlessandFar #DavaoCity #Streetfood\n\nMore videos here: https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nFollow Kulas! https://www.youtube.com/user/Jennermann\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Safely\" - Homebody\nFrom Epidemic Sound\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "This Philippines Travel vlog almost kicks off with a disaster. On our Fighter Boys road trip through Northern Samar, our Drive Shaft breaks. This is a serious problem, as in some cases this can launch a truck into the air. Luckily this time all we had to do is wait for the local mechanics to fix it, we rewarded them with a giant box of Fighter Wine.\n\nWe then visit the beautiful Bangon falls. A cool cascading waterfall in the heart of the jungle. The Fighter Boys were very ready for a quick shower after all day in the sun waiting for the bus to be fixed.\n\nLast year I travelled for 3 months as a foreigner in the Philippines before concluding my filipino travel vlog series with the Fighter Boys trip with Kyle Jennermann of Becoming Filipino, Daniel Marsh, Finn Snow, Bret Maverick. Nicknamed the Fighter Boys, after our sponsor Fighter Wine. \n\nHope you enjoyed this wild video!

        "description": "This is Las Coloradas Yucatan, the rainbow salt flats of Rio Lagartos Mexico. It took us 4 trips to get this one right, and finally we got a our quadcopter the DJI Inspire 1 drone flight in! You can find pools of green, orange, and pink here. These are ancient drying beds for salt, the more pink the water, the higher the concentration. This place is in the middle of nowhere, and is a helluva thing to see! It's similar to Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia, just add a little bit more color ;)\n\nIn our 4 visits to Las Coloradas, we only saw about 5 other people visiting. It's basically unheard of, and you can spend the whole day by yourself there. The drive from Merida or Cancun is about 3 hours, but it's worth it as there's lots of other things to see up there as well. Flamingos, Mud Baths, Dolphins, etc.\n\nIf Mexico is on your travel list, and you find yourself in the Yucatan Peninsula, make the trip to Las Coloradas.\n\nMore Amazing Places: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW_NNmw_ILi3Job3GlVKyxD3UUaTWJ-Ad\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nMy Steadicam to keep things Balanced: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nThanks for Mariannela Cataño for helping out!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♫ Music: \"Inspiring Fantas\" - Sonicscope\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here:\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯",

        "description": "Welcome to the surreal gardens of Las Pozas de Edward James.\nIt's a fantasy world tucked away in the Jungles of Xilitla, a Pueblo Magico of Mexico. Built by an eccentric Millionaire, and slowly being reclaimed by the forest, Las Pozas is one of the secrets of San Luis Potosi. It's an amazing place we only heard about by chance, but happy we could add it in... cause damn... I've never seen anything like it.\n\nWalking in the doors of Las Pozas, you begin to see a sculpture park being taken over by nature. During the hours we spent there, we didn't see very many other tours or tourists. Perhaps it's because of the labyrinth like design, but there was a lot of time we were just relaxing by the pools all by ourselves\n\nGetting to San Luis Potosí took us a little while. We drove up from Mexico City to see Las Pozas de Xilitla and Cascada Tamul. We didn't realize how much there is to see here. Puente de Dios, Sotano de Golondrinas, and much more... As a Canadian visiting Mexico, I'm not used to so much density of cool things to do. \n\nMore Adventures: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLW_NNmw_ILi2f1i420TZR68ie5HJF9-V7\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nMy Steadicam to keep things Balanced: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nBig thanks to Mariannela Cataño for being an awesome actress!\n\nAnd big love to Hoteles Mission for hosting us!\nhttp://www.hotelesmision.com.mx/\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♫ Music: “Butterfly\" by TimMono\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here:\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯",

        "description": "This the coolest airbnb I've ever stayed in. There are some amazing things to do in Mexico City, and if you want to travel just a short distance outside of it, you'll find the Nido de Quetzalcoatl or Quetzalcoatl's Nest tucked inside the valleys of Naucalpan.\n\nIt is a series of 10 apartments build into the back of a giant serpent. It's the coolest house I've ever seen, if you don't mind living in a snake god.\n\nThis park was created by Javier Senosiain, a Mexican architect specializing in Organic Architecture. This philosophy of construction blends seamlessly with nature, so they both work together in harmony. When Javier first decided to build the park, he came across a giant cave whose opening resembled the gaping mouth of a snake. This inspired him to continue the theme, and great a giant 18 hectare park, with 13 snakes twisting through it. Despite everything he has created here, the valley in which everything is hidden, is vastly untouched. His constructions are guided using the natural shape of the land. \n\nAs far as things to do in Mexico, this is an absolute must. I have never seen anything like this in all of my years as a travel vlogger. It is truly an oasis hidden away from the bustle of Mexico City\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nTO VISIT:\n\nAt this time you have two options. A private tour or staying in the apartment. Our contact for both of these is Patricia. Her email: mopacastillo(at)gmail.com\n\nThe easiest, and which that allows you the most freedom is to stay there overnight. It is a 8-10 person apartment, with a recommended minimum of 2 nights. This can sometimes be negotiated depending on the time of year. Get some friends together and split the cost. It is worth it.\n\nThe Airbnb Listing is here: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10153978\n\nIf you don't have an Airbnb account, you can my link to get $35 off your first booking: www.airbnb.com/c/mcorey24\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nCheck out Mariannela!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\nBrendan Behind the Camera:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/bvans890\n\nMy man Steve:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/BackPackerOrg\n\nJodie\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/alajode\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a gift from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Carillon Dancer\" - Marco Belloni\n\n\"Tone\" - OGROD\nhttps://soundcloud.com/maciejkulesza\n\n\"Happiness\" - FunkyFella\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Petare, located on the eastern outskirts of Caracas, is one of the largest and most densely populated slums in Latin America. Known for its vibrant culture and resilience, Petare is also infamous for its high crime rates and extreme poverty. Violence is a daily reality, with armed gangs, drug trafficking, and kidnappings shaping the lives of many residents. Even locals must navigate the streets with caution, as petty crime and violent confrontations can erupt without warning. Security forces are often outnumbered or compromised, making it a challenging environment for law enforcement. For travelers, entering Petare without a trusted guide or local knowledge is highly discouraged, as the risks of robbery or worse are significant. Despite these dangers, Petare is also home to a community striving for change, with grassroots organizations working tirelessly to offer hope and opportunity in one of Venezuela’s most perilous regions.\n\nSupport Petare and donate to Unos Venezolanos! \nhttps://www.unosvenezolanos.com/apoyo-monetario\n\nWANT TO VISIT VENEZUELA?

If you like doing a taste test of local street food in any culture. This country has some of the best!\n\nWe hit a street market just beside Chapultepec Castle. Here you can find all kinds of interesting Mexican street foods and candies. In particular we were searching for a weird one called DoriLocos. This is when you take a bag of Doritos, cut it open, and add all sorts of typical Mexican Salsas and spices. It starts with carrots and cucumbers, then Cueritos (pig skin fat), Valentina, Miguelito, Chamoy, peanuts (Cacuates Japones), and you top it off with lime. \n\nWhile maybe not that traditional, this snack is very common in the street.

This is right after some epic hiking to fairy meadows to get a view of Nanga Parbat.\n\nNorthern Pakistan is beautiful, and we discover all sorts of interesting things in this episode.\n\nWe start off in Karimabad where we try on some tardition Pakistani clothing from the area. There was even a rock tea! I'll have it next time. After we hike up the steep hills to Baltit Fort. From the top you can really see howe incredible the valley is. There are towers of stone in every direction.\n\nWe continue our road trip to Attabad lake which was created by an avalanche which blocked a river. It's vibrant blue, and somewhere below the surface there is a drowned town. That's an adventure for another day.\n\nPakistan tourism is on the rise. It's often called a dangerous place to travel. Our purpose was to spend our time, as foreigners in Pakistan to disprove this, and show the beauty of the people and the landscape to the world. CPIC Global sponsored out trip, but we did so without any security or military escorts. The only trouble we got into was bumpy roads.\n\nWhile normally I solo travel, I was excited to have so many friends on the trip.

This is a traditional Mexican drink you need to try. drink Templo de Diana is a Pulqueria in Xochimilco, CDMX. It serves a drink you probably haven’t heard of before.\n\nHere you can try an ancient Aztec drink called Pulque, the fermented sap of a kind of cactus called Maguey.\n\nBoth agave and maguey have been extremely important in the history of Mexico. These two kinds of plant have been distilled, fermented, dried, twisted, and cut into all sorts of useful things. Everything from alcohol to rope.\n\nPulque itself has a very interesting history. It was the drink of choice for hundreds of years by the Aztecs. When the beer brands arrived they saw this slimy white drink dominating their niche, and spread rumors about it being Fermented in the same barrels as human feces. This killed Pulque, and the beer companies won.\n\nWe set out to try the strangest flavors they had. Celery, beet, and Oyster. Would you give it a shot?\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nMariannela Cataño:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\nBackpacker Steve:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/BackPackerOrg\n\nBrendan Van Son\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/bvans890\n\nJodie Dewberry\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/alajode\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

I teamed up with Kyle Jennermann (Kulas) of Becoming Filipino to create a Philippines travel vlog about this bull penis and testicle dish in Cagayan de Oro, Mindanao.\n\nI had first heard of this Pinoy delicacy in while researching Manila street food. Soup number 5, RM Soup, Remember Me are all names for this dish. It is often eaten as a hangover food and aphrodisiac (why do weird foods always increase your sex drive?)\n\n It turns out it a bit hard to find. I know the Best Ever Food Review Show had some false leads in Manila, but Kulas had a great place, called RM Station in Cagayan de Oro. We got lucky, they have full penis and testicles that had not been cut up into soup. I never thought I would have to type that sentence. \n\nHave you guys checked out the Fighterboys series yet?\nMake sure to check out my boys, Bret Maverick, Daniel Marsh, Finn Snow, and last but definitely not least Kyle Jennermann who helped me create this video.

Starting off our day, we visit Lamitan City, home of the weavers, here we are given beautiful headbands as a gify from the village elder, and I try my hardest to crack a coconut. After we grab a lunch and I somehow find myself trying Betel Nut again, (Called Apo here), and we explore a columnar basalt waterfall called Bulingan Falls... and I can tell you, it's one of the best waterfalls in the Philippines. While visiting this island might not be at the top of Foreigner tourist list of the top things to do in the Philippines, we hope that soon people will begin to return to this beautiful island.\n\nA bit more backstory on Basilan, and this series.\nThis small island has had a lot of trouble in the past. Muslim extremist groups have damaged its people and its reputation. As a foreigner in the Philippines, everyone told me to stay away from the south. Mindanao was \"dangerous\" and \"no one should go\", is what I was told by both filipinos and foreign travelers. After the Mindanao roadtrip with the Fighterboys, I would have to disagree. Love and generosity is what we experienced, an appreciation from the people that I have rarely felt while travelling the world. We met the governor of ARMM, our local contact (always have a local contact) and spent 4 days here. While I wouldn't recommend travelling here on your first day in the Philippines, \n\nThis is Day 2 of exploring Basilan Mindanao Philippines.\n\n#FearlessandFar #Basilan #Mindanao\n\nI post wild stories and travel tips here: https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nFind Kulas here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Jennermann\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n“Znikne” - OGROD\n\n\n“Barely Floating” - Ooyy\n“Bonita” - Beiba\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "In this Philippines travel vlog, we visit Camiguin Island in Northern Mindanao. I've been wanting to visit ever since some filipino subscribers told me about the sunken cemetery on the island. My expat friend Kyle Jennermann (Becoming Filipino), and his buddy Kumar connected me with Aitz, a local who own a place on the island called Hayahay Cafe.\n\nIn this travel video, we visit the Kibila Giant Clams Sanctuary, and another smaller coral and clam sanctuary. One day was spent free diving, and the other SCUBA diving. \n\nI learned a lot about giant clams that day. There are 9 species in the world, 6 of which can be found in the Philippines. The are much like coral; a symbiotic relationship between an animal and a plant, where each feeds the other. Giant clams are colourful because of the algae that live inside their mantle. This algae uses photosynthesis to create food from the sun. The clam sucks in water and filters out the plankton. Teamwork for the win.\n\nThis also means, like coral, giant clams can bleach. When the algae living inside the clams skin (or mantle) doesn't like the water conditions, it leaves. Since this algae gives coral and clams their colour, the animal turns white.

        "description": "The fighter boys take on the Chocolate Hills in Bohol! \n\nLast year I travelled for 3 months as a foreigner in the Philippines before concluding my filipino travel vlog series with the Fighter Boys trip with Kyle Jennermann of Becoming Filipino, Daniel Marsh, Finn Snow, Bret Maverick. Nicknamed the Fighter Boys, after our sponsor Fighter Wine. We did a 2 week road trip through Mindanao\n\nThis year our sights were set on some different islands. Our first in this series was Camiguin Island, and now we've landed in Bohol.\n\nThe Chocolate hills in Bohol are definitely a mainstream attraction in Bohol. However, we all enjoy carving our own path in life and travel, and soon found ourselves on a dirt path trying to find our own private experience. \n\nWe found exactly that. This place was special, and I hope you can see that in this Philippines travel vlog.\n\nJoin the Adventure Newsletter\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/join-our-adventure-newsletter\n\n#FearlessandFar #fighterboys #bohol #chocolatehills\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nBecoming Filipino:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Jennermann\n\nDaniel Marsh:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiNCvGzwadWCZIzTUjoApRQ\n\nBret Maverick:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/27bretzki\n\nFinn Snow:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Finnur12345\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "The MUSA Underwater Museum. Between Cancun and the island of Isla Mujeres in Mexico, there is an incredible place to Scuba dive. It's an underwater sculpture park, acting as a coral reef for all of the incredible animals underwater.\n\nJason Decaires Taylor a British scultor created the very first park of this kind in 2009. Now it attracts Scuba divers and snorkelers from all over the world. A diving highlight of Riviera Maya and the Yucatan Peninsula, it's really easy to get to from Cancun. I hopped on the ferry from Puerto Juarez to Isla Mujeres and found myself a hostel called PocNa. We did a few dives together. 3 on the museum to shoot this video, another few on the nearby Manchones reef, which has a few more sculptures and an incredible amount of fish.\n\nWe also did a dive at the nearby wreck called GunBoat 58 during eagle ray mating season. That.... was a show.\n\nIf you're not Scuba Certified, you need to join the club. There are a lot of PADI dive centres down there that can hook you up. The earth is 70% water, and we only explore the 30% that is land.

        "description": "The Tulamben USAT Liberty Shipwreck is some of best scuba diving in Bali Indonesia. It's quite famous actually, the diving here is very unique. In very few places on this planet is there a wreck this big, or this close to the shore. The wreck acts as a pseudo coral reef, and attracts animals big and small to hide in it's crevices. The beautiful thing about the USAT Liberty wreck is that you can snorkel or free dive it. The bow is only a couple meters from the surface, and you can just walk in from the shore. Normally dive sites like this are far beneath the surface, way too deep for anything but scuba equipment.\n\nIt's a beautiful place, and totally worth checking out.\n\n I did a special birthday trip after a great few weeks on the #tripofwonders with Travel Indonesia.

        "description": "This scuba dive, wow. Cenote Angelita in Tulum, Mexico was amazing. First off, it's a deep one at 34m (100ft). Secondly,  there is a 10 foot thick layer of Hydrogen Sulfide at 30m you are able to pass through. Hydrogen Sulfide is poisonous, and heavily smells of rotten eggs. (I couldn't show you that part in the video). Once through, it turns into a night dive, and you need to use your torches. You only have a few minutes beyond the layer before you have to start ascending again. It's a murky landscape, with petrified trees sticking out of the cloud. Mayans believed that cenotoes were the gateway to the underworld, and yeah, after visiting this one in particular, I can see why.\n\nThis was probably one of the most advanced dives I've done. It's not technically difficult, but it is a mental challenge. It's not uncommon for divers to panic a little bit and have difficulty passing the layer. Like always in diving, keeping a calm mind is the most important thing. Anyone can do this dive, it's just remembering to breathe, and realizing you'll be fine.\n\nThere are a lot of cenote cave dives scattered all through Riviera Maya, Quintanaroo and Yucatan. I was lucky do quite a few during my travels here. I thought that I wanted to get my Cave Diving cerification, but realized that \"Cavern\" diving (when you can still see ambient light) is all I really wanted. You just need to have an advanced cert.\n\nIt was the most exhilarating dive I've done yet, I'm not sure if there is anything else like it on the planet.

Here, you can see many example of Filipino Culture. Specifically the regions of ARMM the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao; Basilan, Sulu, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, and Tawi-Tawi\n\nWe found some strange Filipino food, A tuntungan instrument, kris blades, and some awesome people to party with. As a foreigner in the Philippines, it was a very warm welcome ❤️\n\nA bit more backstory on Basilan, and this series.\nThis small island has had a lot of trouble in the past. Muslim extremist groups have damaged its people and its reputation. As a foreigner in the Philippines, everyone told me to stay away from the south. Mindanao was \"dangerous\" and \"no one should go\", is what I was told by both filipinos and foreign travelers. After the Mindanao roadtrip with the Fighterboys, I would have to disagree. Love and generosity is what we experienced, an appreciation from the people that I have rarely felt while travelling the world. We met the governor of ARMM, our local contact (always have a local contact) and spent 4 days here. While I wouldn't recommend travelling here on your first day in the Philippines, \n\nThis is Day 3 of exploring Basilan Mindanao Philippines.\n\n#FearlessandFar #Basilan #Mindanao\n\nI post wild stories and travel tips here: https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nFind Kulas here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/Jennermann\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a discount from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n“Funky Gringo\" - Funky Fella\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\nOGROD \nhttps://soundcloud.com/maciejkulesza\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "While looking for things to do in Oaxaca City over Christmas, I found this strange and unique festival that happens every 23rd of December called Noche de Los Rabanos, or Night of the Radishes.\n\nIt all started over 100 years ago when farmers would bring their vegetables to be sold at the Christmas Market in the Zocalo, also known as the main square. There were many Mexicans selling their goods there, and the competition was tough. One day one of the farmers thought \"How can I get people to stop at my vegetable stand?\n\" He began carving radishes to attract customers. The other saw this, and began to copy him. Each year they build larger and more extravagant sculptures and \"Night of the Radishes\" was born. \n\nThese days, it has become quite a attraction in Oaxaca City. Thousands of people, mostly locals, wait hours in line to see over 100 exhibits. The event starts in the afternoon, and goes until midnight.\n\nBig thanks to Enjoy Oaxaca for hooking us up with a press pass to get a closer look into the festival!

I teamed up with Eva Zu Beck and Cholo Bangadesh Tours to take a deep dive into Dhaka Street Food, but I wanted to try something a little bit different.\nKnowing how inexpensive it was to eat on the street, I wanted to know if it was even possible to eat 10 USD of the best street food in Bangladesh. We skipped breakfast and lunch to do this food challenge. \nDo you think we made it through?\n\nDhaka street food we tried in this video:\n\nKola bhorta\nFuchka \nChotpoti\nPayesh\nBakorkhani \nBananas\nBhapa pitha\nBeef chaap\nBoti kebab\nagun Paan (fire paan)\npineapple\nPatishapta pitha\nPuli Pitha \nMaalpowa\n\nLet me know which looked the best!\n\nJoin the Adventure Newsletter\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/join-our-adventure-newsletter\n\nEXPERIENCES OVER POSSESSIONS SHIRTS\nhttps://shop.fearlessandfar.com/\n\n#FearlessandFar #Bangladesh\n\n-------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nCheck out the LOCALLY owned and operated Cholo Bangladesh Tours:\nhttp://www.cholobangladeshtours.com/\n\nCheck out Eva's Channel.

        "description": "Ashgabat Turkmenistan is one of the strangest cities I have ever made a travel vlog about.\n\nRecently brought to the attention of the world through John Oliver's popular program Last Week Tonight, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, Turkmenistan's Dictator/President is quite a character.\n\nHowever the craziness it didn't all start with him. Turkmenistan's first president, Turkmenbashi, set quite a powerful precedent. \n\nHe instated many strange rules for the country, and for the city of Ashgabat. No opera, it's too noisy, no makeup on television, the natural beauty of the Turkmen people is enough, and no dogs. Dogs were not allowed in the Capital city of Ashgabat due to their \"foul odor\".... what?\n\nWe only had a short day in Ashgabat before continuing our trip to Merv, and eventually to roast marshmallows over the door to hell. We were able to do some sightseeing to the Arc of Neutrality, which is topped with a golden rotating statue of Turkmenbashi, also the wedding palace of happiness, and the world's largest indoor Ferris Wheel, which is the next vlog 👌🏻\n\nWe visited in early 2019, but it's worth putting on your radar for 2020. The new president Gurbanguly has opened up the country much more than it used to be. Getting the VISA wasn't a walk in the park, but our friends at Lupine Travel set everything up for us..

        "description": "See the shots too raw for YouTube, and support Fearless & Far on Patreon 🐉https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\nWe film some strange stuff on Fearless & Far. In this video we talk about the Top 5 demonetized travel videos I've posted so far, no doubt there is more to come. It's quite common for my vlogs to get flagged.\n\nWhen watching videos on my channel, you know you are signing up for a special kind of travel vlog. I'm a travel vlogger that is not for everybody, some travel videos are only for those who wish to see the strange, unique, and undiscovered places on our planet.\n\nFrom Hanging Coffins, to soup number 5, the vegetarian festival and La Tomatina, some of the festivals, events and destinations are rightfully demonetized, and others maybe not. At this point I'm just happy I'm not banned.\n\nHere's a break down of some of the content that has been demonetized on my channel.\n\nLa Tomatina is the biggest food fight in the world. 50,000 people all show up to the sleepy little town of Buñol, Spain once a year in August to throw Tomatoes at each other for an hour. The travel video I made was demonetized about a year later. While it might look like I’m in the middle of a massacre, it seems like everyone but YouTube can realize that it’s only thousands of mashed tomatoes. Even after appealing the flag over and over, they have not let me monetize it again, and it’s deemed “inappropriate” https://youtu.be/DtA8zS3nlrc\n\nThe Vegetarian Festival sounds like a harmless celebration. It's not. Happening in many locations in South East Asia, with many different names. This festival is about pain tolerance and possession. Practitioners pierce their skin with all sorts of items to show their devotion to the gods. It was rightfully demonetized. Ouch.\nhttps://youtu.be/JFyfjCx3EEQ\n\nSoup Number 5 seems like a harmless item on this list. It's a delicacy in the Philippines. Also called Remember Me Soup or RM Soup it's the cut up manhood of a bull, sliced in a beautifully delicious broth. The Philippines is not short of strange but surprisingly delicious food. A big shout out to my Filipino subscribers for finding some great ones for me.\nhttps://youtu.be/T--Z_ZI83Bc\n\nThe Trunyan Cemetery was rightfully demonetized, and I still can’t believe this really exists. On an island in a small lake in Northen Bali, there is a strange cemetery, and an even more strange tradition around death. There is a tree on this small island that is suppose to be the only one in existence. This tree releases one of the most beautiful scents in the world. So much so, that it begun to cause a problem to the residents of the small town of Trunyan. Long story short, love makes people do crazy things. To win the heart of a woman, a man discovered that placing the deceased around this tree cancelled out the smell. Now for a thousand years later, there is a pile of skulls, and 11 bodies laying open face next to the tree. The practice still continues. https://youtu.be/5M5HHWLOMeQ\n\nThe Botfly experience was a recent adventure that many of you probably saw. While travelling in Belize, a small fly landed on my skin and laid an egg. There really wasn’t anything I could do to stop this from happening. It’s just bad luck. Fast forward 5 weeks later and I’m on the other side of the world travelling with a friend, and discover that the strange pimple on my wrist has a dark secret… it’s the home of a skin parasite. A developing larva. I’m a parasitic host to a Botfly.\nhttps://youtu.be/rs-Uifguu2w\n\nThe Day of the Dead festival in Mexico was a surprise. https://youtu.be/MWwT-r2uBv4\n\nAnother Travel Vlog that was unexpectedly demonetized was “Toques Electricos”.https://youtu.be/vbok03kDy1o\n\nHope you enjoyed this video! Which deserved it, and which didn't?\n\n#FearlessandFar #Demonetized #Travel\n\nEXPERIENCES OVER POSSESSIONS SHIRTS\nhttps://shop.fearlessandfar.com/\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "Khaplu in Gilgit-Baltistan in Northern Pakistan in Beautiful.\n\nIn this travel vlog we start out at Khaplu palace, where we had previously spent the night. Here we’re invited to a high tea in a balcony overlooking the towering mountains surrounding the area.\n\nWhile driving along the Karakoram Highway, we saw some kids playing soccer in the Cold Desert.\nWe stopped to go film this incredible game in the blowing sand, when returning to the road a traveling troop of musicians had pulled over as well, they saw us with cameras, came down from the top of the van and started a party. We all joined!\n\nPakistan tourism is on the rise. It's often called a dangerous place to travel. Our purpose was to spend our time, as foreigners in Pakistan to disprove this, and show the beauty of the people and the landscape to the world. CPIC Global sponsored out trip, but we did so without any security or military escorts. The only trouble we got into was bumpy roads.\n\nWhile normally I solo travel, I was excited to have so many friends on the trip. Siya Zarabi from Hopscotch the Globe, Lexie Alford from Lexie Limitless, Ryan Riel from Opposite Travellers, Anushae Khan, Brooke Saward, and Alexandrina Cojocaru.\n\n\nAlso, I post extra videos on my Patreon.

        "description": "Pancita Mexicana or Menudo. Cow Stomach Soup for you english speakers... is a Mexican Street Food I have seen in a lot of Mexico City markets. This country has some strange, weird, and crazy things to eat, and this one is not too hard to find.\n\nFrom what I heard, people either love it or hate it. It's history goes all the way back to the Spanish conquest, where the locals were given the scraps of left over meat to eat. They decided to make the best of it, and that was the birth of a lot of these stranger street foods in Mexico.\n\nExploring with Cody and I found this Mexican specialty in the Mercado de Coyoacan, or Coyoacan food market. Here, you can find everything... street tacos, garnachas, pozole, pancita de res, and even sesos (brians) which we ate on Cody's channel.\n\nHaving lived in Mexico City for almost a year, I had surprisingly not tried this Mexican snack, but I had seen it everywhere. Trying it is definitely one of the top things to do in Mexico.\n\nAfter making this video, I learned that maybe we had made a mistake... Are both of these flour? Or is one actually the real one?\n\nMexico is so much more than just tacos. There is god level street food here, allowing for some great food videos. Would you give this a taste test? Did we eat pancita right? Did we do something wrong in the preparation? let us know! \n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nExploring with Cody https://www.youtube.com/user/SirCodyBuffinton\n\nHis Brain video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDkmc2g_Rlg&t\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a gift from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\nAll by Funky Fella\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

We join with TOCHKA 4x4 a local adventure group for some serious off roading. \n\nWhile we realize that happened next is not an accurate depiction of everyday Russia, we were surprised with some traditional music, and guns. We were offered the opportunity my birthday by firing off a few rounds in the forest, we had never done this before. Though, I admit we wanted to. This small part of Russian culture is definitely the Russian stereotype, and it was a lot of fun to join the locals celebrating this way for a night.\n\nNext we met a group of pagans living simply in the forest. Here, we helped them create trinkets with molten metal, another first for me.\n\nLastly we were invited to dinner at the house of a Russian Oligarch (Who had a tank in his front yard), and drank vodka while being served some incredible Russian Food.\n\nA bit of a background story. This is a train journey of 10,000 km across Russia, the biggest country in the world. 25 days to visit Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Krasnoyarsk, Ulan-Ude, and Vladivostok. \n\nA big thank you to the sponsors of the #TransSibChallenge\n- Russian Geographical Organization - https://www.rgo.ru/en\n- Svoya Tropa Russia Tour Operator - https://svoya-tropa.com/ \n\nPatreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\nEXPERIENCES OVER POSSESSIONS SHIRTS\nhttps://shop.fearlessandfar.com/\n\n#FearlessandFar #Russia #TransSibChallenge\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\nFRIENDS FEATURED\n\nGARETH LEONARD https://www.youtube.com/tourist2townie\nRUBEN - https://www.youtube.com/ChannelLetsGo\nTOCHKA 4x4 - www.instagram.com/tochka4x4\nYAROSLAV - If you're interested in anything we did on this trip, contact Yaroslav.

Here's what I caught on camera.\n\nBangkok Thailand is backpacking paradise with so many things to do. \nWhile definitely not off the beaten path, Bangkok nightlife, thai food, temples, and thai culture, attract tourists from all over the world.\n\nThailand is called the land of smiles, but due to all the tourists that flock there, it's also the land of scams. Khao San Road is the Backpacker area. It's a walking street and it's crazy. Scorpions on sticks, laughing gas, ping pong shows, and a large amount of thai street food. It's an easy area to potentially find scams and trouble.\n\nListen, the last thing I want to do is to scare anyone away from travelling.

        "description": "MARIANNELA'S VIDEO TOMORROW 2/11/17\n\n50k Subscribers! You're all the best. I have a food challenge for you today to celebrate. Eating the spiciest burger in the world!\n\nThere's this great American style burger place on Alvaro Obregon in Colonia Roma, Mexico City. We went there for the first time a few months ago, and I saw a challenge on the menu \"Eat the hottest burger in the world, with fries and a litre of beer in 3 minutes\" I bookmarked that for later and here we are today,... both about eat one of the spiciest creations in Mexico (they say the world).\n\nWhile this particular challenge didn't have the spiciest pepper in the world, the naga chilli (or ghost pepper) it did have a tower of Serrano and Habaneros peppers. Serranos being 5 times hotter than Jalapeños and Habaneros 30 times hotter. It wasn't a joke.\n\nFor real though, It felt like a speed eating competition. My spice tolerance is high, so the burn really only hit me midway. To feel the full heat you have to sit back, but there was no time for that in this challenge. This was a true man vs food scenario, and while it might not stack up to furious pete or hot ones on first we feast... this thing was straight fire!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nBig thanks to the Burger Bar Joint in Roma, Mexico City\nhttp://www.burgerbarjoint.rest/sucursal-la-roma/\n\nHere's Mariannela's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\nQuiet Contemplation 18 - Christian Andersen\n\nBack In The Days - Andreas Jamsheree\n\nStreet Beats - Jack Elphick\n\nGetting Tipsy 2 - Martin Landh \n\nAll from Epidemic Sound \n\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "MY INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind/\n\nIn the beginning, I had no interest in photography. It seemed complicated, and video was much more attractive. I came across a night photography and light painting tutorial video, and then that all changed. Learning photography is the secret to making beautiful videos. Most of what you learn transfers over directly. It's the key to making art with a camera.\n\nWhen taking photos, the best way to learn is to play. Getting ideas by watching videos about tips, tricks, hacks, how-to's, then going out and make your version of the idea. It's not stealing, it's inspiration, and it's how creatives get creative.\n\nWe filmed this video in Harinera Nacional, and abandoned flour factory in the north of Mexico City. This place has an interesting history, it exploded about 15 years ago, and now has become a bit of a haven for graffiti artists, and urban exploring.\n\nSome important things to keep in mind when light painting:\n- You need a tripod to stabilize the camera\n- The camera cannot move.\n- You'll probably need to manual focus due to the darkness\n- Use light like a paintbrush. Paint the areas you want to show. \n- Use a long shutter speed (we did 30s)\n- Have fun. It usually takes a couple tries.\n\nMake sure to check out my friends Raul & Ale (links below) Both YouTubers here in CDMX.\nThey also made vlogs here. We had an interesting end of the night.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nAle Ivanova is great! https://www.youtube.com/aleivanova\n\nSo is Raul! https://www.youtube.com/user/RaaRaul\n\nCheck them out!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n “Driving in the Dark\" - Andreas Jamsheree\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "It's unbelievable. Not even 24h after my iPhone X was stolen in an Uber, my wallet disappears. After visiting the Mexico City Witchcraft market (Mercado Sonora) last week, I have been asked many times.. Have I been cursed? Did the witch that did the Limpia, the spiritual cleaning... actually do the opposite?\n\nI had to go back and watch the footage again. I didn't understand everything the witch was saying the first time. When we wanted to film, she insisted no. We kept pushing and she eventually said that she would do a fake limpia spell but \"It will not do him good\" We clarified that it didn't necessarily mean it was going to do me bad... it just mean't it wouldn't do anything. She responded again \"It won't do him good\"\n\nShe then proceeded to channel her invisible assassins, terrorists, and body guards (her words) to put a cleaning spell on me. We later heard this witch was an imposter, and not who she said she was. So what did you use on me Black Magic, or White Magic?\n\nI honestly don't believe too much in these things, but I have to wonder why so many problems happened right after? Coincidence? It's just so strange.\n\nWe are hoping to find a mystery man to fix this problem, and clean my bad luck. Stay tuned for part 3.\n\n---------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nMariannela Catano\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫  \n\n\"Appeased Soundscape 03\" - August Wilhelmsson\n\n(http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯",

        "description": "This Mindanao road trip has been amazing. In this Philippines travel vlog, myself and the rest of the fighter boys end up in Bukidnon after having visited Davao City.\n\nWe meet the Talaandig. A tribe in north central Mindano known for their soil paintings, music, dance, and their history as the peace keepers of the island.\n\nThe Talaandig have a very elaborate initiation ceremonies in which all new visitors must participate. Tabacco and Betelnut is chewed, prayers are said, and a chicken is sacrificed. This is to please their ancestor's spirits before guests enter and potentially \"eat their food, and walk on their heads\". Datu, the tribe leader guided us through this ceremony when we first arrived.\n\nAs a foreigner in the Philippines, this was an amazing experience for me. The best moments are the ones that challenge you, and this adventure was full of music, food, and pushing my boundaries. I couldn't help keep this travel vlog under 20 minutes. Too much Filipino love and good vibes.

Ever the skeptic about these things, I was hesitant to pursue another witch, or to push too far into the realm of White and Black Magic.\n\nWe were directed to a man named Don Carlos. Who was a master of the Tarot, and was apparently quite gifted. He only appeared in the evenings on a particular bench in Coyoacan, an ancient part of Mexico City. \n\nWe didn't have much to go by. We just knew the location of the bench, we had no idea what he looked like. \n\nLater that evening, he showed himself, and we were able to speak with him... this is the video of that experience.

All my years of travel have taken me to the depths of jungles, the tops of mountains, the bottom of the ocean, but for some reason never into a mosque. After, we visit a crab farm for breakfast. Here we try pastel, and start cracking shells. My reputation precedes me, and they prepare a special surprise for me.\n\nA bit more backstory on Basilan, and this series.\nThis small island has had a lot of trouble in the past. Muslim extremist groups have damaged its people and its reputation. As a foreigner in the Philippines, everyone told me to stay away from the south. Mindanao was \"dangerous\" and \"no one should go\", is what I was told by both filipinos and foreign travelers. After the Mindanao roadtrip with the Fighterboys, I would have to disagree. Love and generosity is what we experienced, an appreciation from the people that I have rarely felt while travelling the world. We met the governor of ARMM, our local contact (always have a local contact) and spent 4 days here.

        "description": "Tultepec is famous for it's fireworks. After the 2017 fireworks explosions, the festivals have not stopped in this tiny mexican town in Estado de Mexico.\n\nKnown as the national fireworks capital of the country, Tultepec has many celebrations year round involving explosions.\n\nThe most famous would be the national pyrotechnics festival that I attended in March 2018. It's a 10 day event with fireworks towers (called castillos), piromusicales (fireworks to music), as well as the burning bulls, (toros de fuego) where locals cover paper mache bulls with explosives.\n\nThe latter is a bit like the quema de judas in Tultepec. Instead of bulls, figures are covered in fireworks, and hung from a rope. These spin, eventually catch fire, and explode violently. Originally from Spain, this tradition was done during easter to burn an effigy resembling Judas, the man who betrayed Jesus. Now Mexico has taken it's on interpretation and began to burn Alebrijes, beautiful fantasy creatures from Oaxaca, as well as not so traditional effigies... Like Goku and Spongebob Squarepants. \n\nI hope you enjoy this Mexico travel vlog with my friend Exploring with Cody, Mariannela, and Dave on Arrival experiencing La Quema de Judas Tultepec 2018!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nExploring with Cody\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/SirCodyBuffinton\n\nDave on Arrival\nHttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc7cpDLG-lt7VaJZBJ-97Mg\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a gift from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n“Funky Gringo\" - Funky Fella\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\n\"Platinum101\" - Niklas Ahltröm (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\"Pretty Awkward\" - BLAEKER  (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n\"Znikne\" - OGROD \nhttps://soundcloud.com/maciejkulesza\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

This is the second travel vlog in our Turkmenistan series!\n\nWhile travelling through Ashgabat, things seem strange. Everything is vibrantly white and gold, and there is no one around... If you're looking for the strangest and most bizarre places to visit in 2020, Turkmenistan might be it.\n\nThe presidents of this country have taken a liking to collecting Guinness World Records. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, Turkmenistan's Dictator/President and the former (now deceased) president Turkmenbashi have decorated the capital of this closed republic with white marble, and buildings built to break records.\n\nHighest density of white marble clad buildings, largest architectural star, and this... the largest indoor Ferris Wheel, and many many more.\n\nWe were able to take a few hours to experience this giant space compass for ourselves, and even take if for a ride. \n\nWe visited in early 2019, but it's worth putting on your radar for 2020. The new president Gurbanguly has opened up the country much more than it used to be. Getting the VISA wasn't a walk in the park, but our friends at Lupine Travel set everything up for us..

        "description": "This is a cool scuba dive. The Pit Cenote, or El Pit is one of the many amazing things to see near Tulum. The Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico is like a giant ant colony of Cenotes, underground rivers, and sink holes. It's a diving and snorkeling playground, and you could spend weeks here just seeing the sights underwater. While there are hundreds of cenotes scattered across Yucatan and Quintana Roo, this particular hole cuts deeper into the ground than most. It's called The Pit for a reason, and for myself, it was my very first Cavern Dive.\n\nI arrived here with the expectation of getting my Cave Diving certification, it turns out there is a type of diving called Cavern Diving. This means you never leave the guide line, and you always are able to see ambient light. This was enough for me, as on several of these dives we were well underground, with only a faint glow in the distance of sunlight. You have to be an advanced scuba diver to be allowed to participate in this type of dive. I highly recommend you get certified that high!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nSony Alpha a7S Digital Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony 16-35mm FE F4 ZA OSS: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 55mm F1.8 Sonnar T FE ZA: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nSony FE 90mm f/2.8-22 Macro G OSS: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\n\nRode VideoMic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nSanDisk Extreme PRO 64GB SD Card: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nPD Capture Camera Clip: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPD Capture Lens Kit: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPD slideLITE Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPD Rain Shell Cover: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\n3 Legged Thing Carbon Fiber Tripod:: http://geni.us/Tripod\nGlidecam HD-2000 Steadicam: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nDJI Phantom 3 4K Drone: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nMake sure to check out infinity2diving (http://www.infinity2diving.com/).

        "description": "We found an abandoned artillery on border between North Korea and Russia. While exploring the outside, a local man came over with a rusty key into the only door. We took urban exploration to a whole new level that day.\n\nThis area of Primorsky Krai was of extreme military importance to Soviet Russia. While, North Korea is just a handful of kilometres away, It's also the front line to China and Japan.\nThis canon battery was built in the early 1900s to fortify the area from a foreign navy. Apparently the explosion from a fired round was so powerful, it would knock vehicles down the cliffs if they were parked too close to the artillery. Wow.\n\nThis is the final episode of our Trans-Siberian Railway adventure, and what a wild experience it was. \n\nA bit of a background story.

        "description": "I can't believe I had my iPhone X stolen from the back of an Uber in Mexico City. \n\nSurprisingly few things of mine have been stolen while travelling. Safety and street sense is something I always pride myself on, but in this case, I wasn't ready for this scenario. \n\nI was finishing up playing some old school games with a friend at a place called Taco Game, and took an uber back with a cool driver through a sketchy part of town. \n\nWe were talking about minimum wage in Mexico, and how people work very hard and receive very little money. As we were driving through Calle Nuevo Leon in Condesa Neighbourhood, we say many prostitutes on the side of the road, and the conversation drifted towards whether that is a lurative job than say, working in a restaurant or a little corner store. We stopped to ask, that was a mistake.\n\nTo be honest, I was quite impressed with the system apple has set up to deal with lost or stolen iphones. We immediately tried Find my iPhone on the Uber driver's phone, but she had turned it off. When I returned to my apartment I could put the iPhone 10 on \"Lost Mode\" where we could program a phone number and a custom message to appear on the lock screen. Also, I was given the option to Erase it completely, making it unusable to anybody without my unique apple ID in the future. Wiping it however, removes the tracking feature from the phone.\n\nAll this only can happen if they iPhone if turned on and connected to the internet again. A new user would need to connect to the internet to be able to use it.\n\nAs of 48 hours later. The phone has still not been turned on. If there is a need to make a part 2. I will do that and make a video about the tracked iPhone, and potentially confront the iphone thief / thieves\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a gift from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Hers\" - OGROD\n\"Violet\" - OGROD\nhttps://soundcloud.com/maciejkulesza\n\n\"Another 90's Anthem\" - Funky Fella\n\"Funky Gringo\" - Funky Fella\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Millions and millions of Monarch butterflies. It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen. We're living in Mexico City, and I had heard a lot about the annual migration of these insects from Canada and USA to the Mexican state of Michoacan. We thought we'd make a video showing you how to go, and also highlight 2 different sanctuaries.\n\nI had thought there was a single viewing zone in the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve, but it turns out there are many sanctuaries. We visited these two: Santuario Sierra Chincua, and Santuario El Rosario. They are suppose to have the most butterflies, and are both near the town on Angangueo in Michoacan. A two day trip seemed like fun, and we headed to the beautiful Pueblo Magico Angangueo\n\nIt was incredible. I had never seen so many in my life. The whole story is quite remarkable actually. Normally a Monarch butterfly only lives 4 weeks, however the Migration takes 6-8 months. How does that work?\nThe generation that has to migrate lives 8 times longer than the others. They fly over 4500 km south to the same place in Mexico. No one knows how they do this, it's one of natures great secrets.\n\nOnce in Michoacán, they breed and clump themselves on a special kind of pine called the Oyamel. It's not as warm as you think here, the elevation is quite high (3500m) and it can get down to almost 0C at night. After a while they travel to Texas to lay their eggs. The food the caterpillars eat is called Milk Weed, and it doesn't exist in Mexico. \nAs Northern North America warms up, they return for the summer. The whole process is 4 generations of butterflies. This means no butterflies make the trip back. It's one way.\n\nEnjoy the vlog!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nMariannela's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n “Summer Spliffs\" - Broke for Free\nTHIS GUY MAKES AWESOME MUSIC.

Mexico is full of haunted, creepy, and forgotten buildings, happy to have them back for some urbex! \n\nOn our first night we went to Plaza Garibaldi, one of the most famous places in CDMX to see Mariachis. All through this area you can see hundreds of men dressed up in fancy clothing, serenading groups with traditional music. It's great place to eat, dance, and drink. It's full of locals, and it's very popular. I had a special challenge here for them. It was a surprise. I wasn't sure if everyone would think it was fun, but I know it was going to be a good travel vlog so... It would be worth it.\n\nIn Plaza Garibaldi there is a drinking game called Los Toques Electricos. When you arrive there, you have to listen. You can hear a man walking around with two metal handles, clinking them together. \nThis man has a box around his neck with cigars, gum, and a device that can deliver a 100V current to anyone brave enough to try. This is Los Toques. You hold the metal handles and he turns the dial to 10V, the skull ornament glows red, and the game begins. \n\nHe told me tourists typically make it to 50V, but Mexicans often make it to 70V. You can try the game solo, or all hold hands in a circle, the shock delivered is the same. The point is to one-up your friends, and set the high score. \n\nWas it painful? Actually, I wouldn't describe it as pain. The feeling was similar to when your arm or leg falls asleep in the beginning, an aggressive tingle. One it hits about 40, it feels like you arms are two cans of compressed air, and are about to burst open. You cannot let go at this point, all your muscles in your arms are contracting as hard as they can. You are at the mercy of the operator.\n\nI would do this again. It was an amazing amount of fun. Just another unbelievable thing to film in country so full of unbelievable things. Excited to share more. \n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "This abandoned water park in Mexico City is one of the most requested locations I visit here in Mexico. I teamed up with my urbex friends Exploring with Josh and Exploring with Cody, and we headed to Bosque Chapultepec, a park (more like a forest) in the heart of CDMX to vlog the adventure together. This abandoned theme park has a dark history, and we wanted to learn more about it.\n\nIt doesn’t look like it, but Atlantis was recently closed. It’s been less than 10 years since it shut it’s doors, yet it looks like a war zone. Being in the middle of such a big city, there have been lots of people come to do graffiti and explore, how it became so thrashed, I have no idea. It looks like it was half demolished. It was good to see the waterslides where still there, as well as some resemblance of what the wave pool used to be like, I had heard you could find tickets, but I didn't come across any. Too much garbage on the ground.\n\nA couple years ago news stories started circulating about seals and dolphins being kept in bad conditions inside the forgotten park. Helicopter footage (shown in the beginning of the video) shows green water, and live animals still living inside after the doors had closed. This rumour still circulates though Mexico City, and this was one of the prime reasons we wanted to explore. Would we still find animals there? Are the rumours true? It was scary to think that they might be.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\nExploring with Josh: https://www.youtube.com/user/theartofrealitycrew\n\nExploring with Cody: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/SirCodyBuffinton\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n“Life in Tinsel Town\" - Magnus Ringbloom\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n\"Clayton\" - BeatheBeat\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Just beside one of the main highways heading north in Bali Indonesia, there is a beautiful abandoned resort now laying almost forgotten. The locals call it Penampakan Hotel Megah Berhantu\n which translates into The Ghost Palace Hotel.\n\nMy friends Exploring with Josh and Cody Buffinton paid this creepy building a visit last year, and I thought I would do the same. I would rank this as one of the top things to see on the island, it really is one of the coolest and most beautiful things to see.\n\nThe most common ghost story, the ones all told by the locals, is that on opening night, all of the guests and staff disappeared, and the building was left abandoned because the spirits of these people come back at night. Another is that many of the people involved in the construction were worked to death, and the ghosts play tricks on anyone who goes inside. A third story, is that the owner was the youngest son of a former Indonesian President, and when the building was opened to the public, he was accused and put on trial for corruption. He then sentenced the death of the judge, was caught, and spent the rest of his life in jail. It’s original name was PI Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Hotel and Resort, though that is mostly forgotten now… the rumours and legends have taken over, and it’s the now the Ghost Palace, one of the most haunted places in Indonesia\n\nNo matter the story, this urbex adventure was wild. Myself, Jackson, and Cody made a travel blog about it. Check out their Instagram accounts, both take amazing shots!\n\nWe also had a snake encounter in the dark always of the basement. He wasn’t big, but he was angry and was attacking everything in sight. Play safe with snakes! I had one as a pet for 10 years so I’m comfortable around them, but they can be unpredictable. Don’t go close unless you are absolutely sure you are safe. Don't be a victim of a snake attack. \n\nThere, now I feel better.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nJackson’s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/jackson.groves/\nCody’s Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thenomad/\nMy Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind/\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\nSharp Experimental - Brilliance Audio\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

Kick the Grind is the past, Fearless and Far is the future. \n\nHere's why.\n \nMy story was never one of kicking the grind. I didn't have a dramatic \"I Quit\" moment, and then left the 9 to 5, I didn't make content about helping people how to do this either. My content was always about the strange places and events in our world. It was about challenging myself (and all of you) with the wilder experiences our planet has to offer. It was about fighting fears and becoming the best version of yourself. That was my style of travel, that idea is what we built our community around.\n\nAfter 7 years it feels like a fresh beginning. Mike Corey of Kick the Grind, is now Fearlessandfar. I thought i would make a travel vlog in my own style to let you know.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nThis was filmed in the Lumiang burial caves in Sagada, Philippines.\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

While there is no snow this time of year, this lake is fed from ground water deep in the earth, and is a constant 5C.\n\nAfter unthawing, we explore Kazan, and try traditional Tartarstan cuisine. This includes Chak-Chak, a famous dessert (so famous that there is a museum... we went.)\n\nWe end the day at the Kazan Kremlin, a beautiful complex featuring one of the nicest mosques I've ever seen.\n\nA bit of a background story.

        "description": "I love having my expectations blown away. I had seen some photos of Gaztelugatxe and couldn't believe something like this could be built. A tiny stone church on the top of an island mountain, with a zigzagging bridge connecting it to the northern coast of Spain. It seemed like a scene from a movie... or maybe season 7 episode 4 of an HBO hit series called Game of Thrones. Yeah, maybe more like that. DRAGONSTONE!\n\nGaztelugatxe is an islet (small island) on the coast of the Spanish province of Biscay in Basque Country. At it's peak, there is a hermitage called San Juan de Gaztelugatxe which was build to honour John the Baptist. This church is 1000 years old, and with its winding staircase, makes you feel you're approaching a medieval castle. Exploring it was a highlight of my travel life. We arrived to see an amazing sunrise beginning to peek over the coast. We had it to ourselves at this time, and recommend you visit then too.\n\nMariannela and I made this travel vlog earlier this year during our 1 month road trip through northern Spain. We grabbed a camper van from Indie Campers, and spent the majority of our time in Basque Country,  and all the videos we made are a bit of a different style as the others. We also had a lot of fun with the MAVIC PRO drone from DJI. Some of the best views I've seen yet. This place was unbelievable. \n\nAlso, I came across a lot of great videos of Basque Country through my friends Alex and Marko Ayling from the Vagabrothers. Make sure to check them out as well.\n\nIf you're a fan of urbex or exploring abandoned places, this needs to be on your bucket list.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nFeaturing the lovely Mariannela Cataño\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n “Ocean\" - Agrostyle\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

Myself and my travel companion Lexie Alford visited this beautiful place late 2018, with the mission to show another side of a country in crisis. We planned to show the beauty of the people, and the natural beauty of the country.\n\nThis is not a video about the current econimical or political situation. This is a Venezuela travel vlog of what we experienced as tourists.\n\nWe begin our adventure from flying from Miami to Caracas. Arrival at the airport was not filmed, we wanted to keep to ourselves until we could understand the real risks involved. He has expected everything to be much better than the news portrayed, and it seemed true. The next morning we take a small prop plane from Caracas to Canaima National Park, home of Angel Falls. Upon arriving we saw nobody, it was deserted except for a few staff who directed us to the hotel.\nThat afternoon we booked a tour to a waterfall known as Salto Sapo, known as Frog Falls, and fell in love immedialtely. This was going to be an incredible trip.\n\n#FearlessandFar #Venezuela #Travel\n\nWant more videos?

        "description": "Parque de los Desvelados or Park of the Sleepless is an abandoned sculpture park South West of Pamplona, Spain. \n\nExploring this place has been on my mind for a while, I came across a list of top 5 creepiest locations in the world, and have been hoping to visit ever since. \n\nThis field of skulls was built as a Momento Mori for visitors. It's a reminder that at some point, whether we are rich or poor, famous or forgotten, we all come to the same end. The creator wanted us to wanted the park to think about life, and also death.\n\nLuis Garcia Vidal built these giant skeletons in the Spanish country side for 30 years starting in 1971. There are approximately 7 here, but they are getting increasing had to find due to how they were created. Luis twisted the branched of sumac trees together, then wrapped these in chicken wire and metal screen. Then, he coated these with a thick layer of white chalky lime paint. It's been 10 years since his death, and many more decades since their creation, many are being consumed by the forest, the wire becoming undone, and the twisted sumac taking life again.\n\nWhy did he build them this way?

        "description": "Mexican Street Food is some of the most delicious and interesting around. We found a man in Coyoacan, Mexico City making Cotton Candy Art on a busy weekend. Called arte con algodón de azúcar in spanish, and he was making figuras for cheap. We asked for a cotton candy flower, a sombrero, and a umbrella, though he had so much more on his list! He was a true cotton candy art pro.\n\nWhat other kinds of Mexican Candy do you like? Have have you seen any other kinds of candy art? Is finding a giant cotton candy flower common where you live? I think sugar art in China and Japan is common too!\n\nThis country has so much more to offer than tacos, burritos, and nachos. Most Mexican food we think of is actually TexMex and not popular here. Mexico has one of the most diverse food cultures in the world, and you have to travel here to see it. The desserts especially!\n\nI hope you enjoyed this street food travel vlog!\nMake sure to check out my friends Exploring with Cody and Mariannela!\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nExploring with Cody https://www.youtube.com/user/SirCodyBuffinton\n\nMariannela http://bit.ly/Mariann_YouTube \n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a gift from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Funky Gringo\" - Funky Fella\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

In this video I travel from Canada to Europe during the 2020 pandemic, and show you some of the main differences along the way. The EU had just opened non-essential travel to select nations around the world, and I took advantage of my Canadian citizenship to be one of the very first tourists to arrive in Europe during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nUpon landing in the European Union, I was only asked where I was going. There were no questionnaires, no temperature checks, or swabs. I wasn't even expected to self quarantine, or isolate myself upon arrival. (even though I chose to). I was a free man.\n\nI hope this video can be useful to those who are planning to travel during Covid19.

        "description": "Hierve el Agua, AKA the Petrified Waterfall of Oaxaca, Mexico, is a very strange place to visit. Located about a 90 minute drive from Oaxaca City, this natural wonder is one of the top things to see in Mexico.\n\nThis adventure kicked off a giant roadtrip with some YouTuber friends of mine. Backpacker Steve, Brendan van Son, Jodie Dewberry, and I jumped in a rental car and drove through Oaxaca to Chiapas in search of waterfalls in Mexico. This particular Mexican Waterfall was very special\n\nThis wonder of nature was high on our list. We arrived early on a Monday morning in the offseason (December), and barely saw anybody until midday.\n\nAlthough appearing similar to a hot spring, the water is actually cold. The bubbling of the water comes from trapped gasses under the ground that bubble up with the mineral rich groundwater. This process is why the location is named The Water Boils in Spanish, even though it not actually boiling.\n\nFrom a distance, these giant rock formations look like cascading waterfalls frozen in time. In photos, it's actually not apparent that it isn't water. There are several of these giant petrified waterfalls at the location, and walking trails connecting them all together.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a discount from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nSteve: https://www.youtube.com/user/BackPackerOrg\nBrendan: https://www.youtube.com/brendanvanson\nJodie: https://www.youtube.com/user/alajode\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Save Me\" - Diplodocus\n\n\"Focus\" - OGROD\n\"Lazy\" - OGROD\n\"Water\" - OGROD\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ogrodmusic\n\n\"Funky Gringo\" - Funkyfella\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "The Museo de Momias de Guanajuato caught me by surprise. I had heard from my Mexican friends that they all visited as kids, so how creepy and shocking could the Mummy Museum be? Very actually... This is one of the most intense and scary things I've seen, and I'm not generally shy to check out haunted, abandoned, or freaky places.\n\nIn the 1970’s, a Mexican wrestler/celebrity called “El Santo” fought these Mexican Mummies off with his side kick the Blue Demon making them famous across the country. These are the cut scenes in the beginning and end of the video of this movie. Since, there has been many other spin offs like the animated La Leyenda De Las Momias\n\nUnlike most other mummies, these bodies are naturally mummified. What's the difference? In ancient Egypt the deceased were disembowelled, their skin treated with different solutions, and body positions set into less fightening poses. Here in the Mexican state of Guanajuato, nature did it's thing without any human intervention.  It's actually a pretty simple phenomenon. Unique in Mexico, the dry salty earth in this area acts like a giant desiccator, perserving the bodies before they can properly decompose.\nReally, it's not too far off the process of making Beef Jerky; add salt, remove the moisture quickly, and the meat doesn't rot. Morbid, but the science is the same.\n\nIf you're part of the crew that loves horror, the paranormal, or ghost stories, this one's for you... except this is real life... and there are hundreds of these scattered across the state in 2 different museums. We happened to visit the one in Celaya because of it's proximity to the exploding hammer festival. If you haven't seen that video yet.... wow, make sure to check it out. It's linked at the end.\n\nI'd thought I'd throw this scary movie together to see what you think. Creepy or cool? Would you go?\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\nCheck out my friend Ryan!

        "description": "Cine Opera was one of the most beautiful theatres in Mexico City. Now it's falling to pieces, and is one the most difficult abandoned buildings to enter in CDMX. It has been on my top 5 list for a long time, and it finally were able to vlog it and go exploring.\n\nIt was opened in 1949 as a movie theatre to show films from around the world to the rich, and for 40 years it did that. In 1985 a giant earthquake rocked the city, destroying hundreds of buildings, and cracking the main screen of the theatre. After, it was a music venue for concerts for 15 years before an \"Altercation\" on stage with the English Gothic Rock band Bauhaus closed it permanently. There is no more information I can find about what happened. How can a band close a place this beautiful permanently?\n\nThis place has 24 hour security, steel bar fences, and locks on all the doors.... I never thought I'd get in.\n\nI had met some friends, La Catapixia who also do urban exploration in Mexico City. We had seen each others videos of other cool locations like the abandoned condominium, Insurgentes 300, and Acropolis the abandoned shopping mall. They got us into to the abandoned cinema, and we went exploring together.\n\nWe were surprised to see that they have cleaned the interior quite a bit. The movie theatre seats were all cleared out, as well as most of the trash. There are plans to renovate it into a cultural centre, and I hope they do. Abandoned or not, it's still a beautiful place.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\nBig Love to my friends La Catapixia.

        "description": "I thought I'd make an epic GoPro Montage of some of the best POV shots I recorded during the exploding hammer festival in Guanajuato, Mexico. \n\nI was told that BBC had tried to use an action camera a couple years ago and it didn't survive the blasts, and that I would be insane to try it too. I thought my old HERO 3 would make it through the explosions if I positioned it right on the hammer, and hey, if it didn't... wouldn't that be an epic way to say goodbye, and I'd go out and buy the new Hero 5 Black, and get that delicious 4k. The Hero 3 plus lived, and I was stoaked with the results\n\nThis is one of the world's most dangerous festivals. The exploding hammer festival, or \"fiesta del martillo explosivo\" in spanish, is an annual festival in San Juan de la Vega, Guanajuato, Mexico. Every February 28th, thousands of people visit this small little down to see locals tape home made explosives to sledgehammers, and slam then into the ground. The explosions are huge, and injuries are very common. It's a strange festival, and one of the most dangerous in the world\n\nThis particular date, is day to celebrate San Juan Bautista, aka John the Baptist, which the town was named after. No one can remember exactly how all the exploding started... but at one point it took place inside the city. Those who participated would follow the parade in the honour of the saint, blasting the hammers to celebrate. After a lot of damage to windows, people, and cars, they moved the hammers out into a field.

        "description": "For those of you who love pimple popping, blackheads, whiteheads and acne on YouTube... this botfly extraction vlog is for you 😂 \n\nWhile travelling in Central America, a little pimple popped up on my wrist. I honestly didn't think anything of it, and continued my travels to Bangkok Thailand. 5 weeks later, and after many attempts at popping it myself, I thought I would head to the hospital to see a dermatologist and see if it really was a blackhead, cyst, zit, pimple, or what. \n\nIt wasn't. Any of those. It was a botfly larvae. Fun!\n\nThis parasitic fly lays a small egg on a little cut on your skin. If you travel in the jungle, you know that you are always covered in cuts. This then hatches very shortly after, and a little maggot burrows in your skin. 2 to 3 months later, you birth a fully grown botfly out of the wound, who going on to repeat the process in someone else. No amount of preventative skin care can save you. \n\nWould you have trusted my master extractor Lexie to cut me open in a hotel room? This is a true travel vlog not for the squeamish!

        "description": "The Rainbow mountains or Montania de Siete Colores in Peru \" are a few hours drive outside of Cusco, and it has a bit of a wild story. \n\nAs far as travel attractions go, it's brand new. You might ask \"how can a mountain be brand new?\" Well, it was covered with snow all year round until 2015. The climate has warmed enough to uncover the beautiful Rainbow underneath. There are several mountains there with these colours, and they say it matches the Cusco flag, which is also a rainbow. \n\nIt's hard to miss it when you walk through the town. It seems like every second tour shop offering hiking, has a Rainbow Mountain trek poster on the outside of the shop offering 1 day tours, 3 day tours, and everything in between.\n\nWe found a freelance guide through a friend. His name was Santos and we locked in a one day trip. That meant a 3am wake up, and a 3 hour drive to the trail head.\n\nIt's quite a hike to the top. It took us about 4 hours to reach the summit and we froze our asses off up there. It's well over 5000m above sea level, which is about double Machu Picchu and Cusco. I had never been at that altitude and you really feel it when you try to walk and talk.\n\nHey, it was all worth it though. It was a unbelievable thing to see, even if I have some mixed feelings about the whole climate change issue. It's not the Peruvians causing problems. \n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nMy Steadicam to keep things Balanced: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nMariannela Cataño - \nhttps://www.instagram.com/mariannnela/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Joyogamx/\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♫ Music: “Xilo\" - Jack Elphick\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here:\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------",

        "description": "The Shinjuku district of Tokyo in Japan is a highlight of any trip to the city. It's home to the Robot Cafe or robot restaurant, one of the top things to do in Tokyo... but just around the corner is a darker attraction. A Horror Cafe called \"The Lock Up\"\n\nThis isn't even the weirdest cafe in the city. There is a Maid Cafe, An Owl Cafe, a Ninja Cafe... and the list goes on. Tokyo cafes have become a bit of a trend, and if you're looking for things to do in Tokyo, book yourself into any of the above experiences.\n\nThe horror cafe experience starts with a normal elevator ride to the 3rd floor. You want in, and then things gets weird (not a strange occurrence in Japan). It all took a surprise turn in the end right as we were about to leave, we almost missed the whole point of the experience. They don't tell you want to expect when you enter inside.

Our first adventure is hiking The Columns. These beautiful magma pillars were formed when lava spurted up from an ancient seabed and cooled as they came in contact with the water. The seabed washed away, turned into a forest, and voila. The perfect place for a Russian travel vlog.\n\nWe also found a Siberian specialty food in Krasnoyarsk. Pinecones. Being Canadian, I didn't know you could eat these things. We have snack on a few on top of pancakes during this journey as well. \n\nA bit of a background story. This is a train journey of 10,000 km across Russia, the biggest country in the world. 25 days to visit Saint Petersburg, Moscow, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Krasnoyarsk, Ulan-Ude, and Vladivostok. \n\nA big thank you to the sponsors of the #TransSibChallenge\n- Russian Geographical Organization - https://www.rgo.ru/en\n- Svoya Tropa Russia Tour Operator - https://svoya-tropa.com/ \n\nPatreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\nEXPERIENCES OVER POSSESSIONS SHIRTS\nhttps://shop.fearlessandfar.com/\n\n#FearlessandFar #Russia #TransSibChallenge\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\nFRIENDS FEATURED\n\nGARETH https://www.youtube.com/tourist2townie\nRUBEN - https://www.youtube.com/ChannelLetsGo\nYAROSLAV - If you're interested in anything we did on this trip, contact Yaroslav.

        "description": "Mexico City is full of abandoned places. I keep on finding cooler and creepier buildings to explore. It's urbex heaven here. This time I was told about an abandoned shopping mall called \"The Acropolis\" in Lomas Verdes, an area in the the western part of CDMX.\n\nIt was a beautiful and creepy adventure. The shopping mall had been abandoned for 20 years, and was beginning to fall into ruins. \nThere are a few place that make this shopping centre different than most malls. First, it was a Middle-Eastern Bazaar style market. There were thousands of shops inside, each one only taking up a few square meters. Second, in the middle of the entire building, the roof opened up into a giant star. At noon it would cast a giant shape in the very middle of the mall. It's an incredible thing to see.\n\nThey modelled the building off the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. Giant carved stone pillars, the triangular archways, and the fact it was perched overlooking the rest of the surrounding city. \n\nThere are a few rumours as to why they abandoned the building. Some conspiracy theories say it was built as a giant money laundering scheme, others suggest that it's strange style didn't catch on. Also, around the same time, a larger mall opened up nearby called Centro Comercial Satelite. This probably didn't help either.\n\nI jumped on this urban exploration with some friends in Mexico City. It was barely boarded up, which made exploring easy. We arrived early in the morning, and didn't see anyone until much later when we were caught by the police. Which... turned out to be not as bad as I thought... We were lucky.\n\nAlso, to you guys who kick seriously ass and read this far. \nI put one frame of the new KtG logo in the video. Message in the comments what second you saw it and I'll send you a surprise.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nINSTA: www.instagram.com/soyeberlanda\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvNovl15nmwV34XkR16XsFw\n\nAlberto Ancona\nINSTA: www.instagram/elDronista\nYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/c/dronismo\n\nAlan\nINSTA: www.instagram/alandodomiguez\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n “Quiet Melody\" - VoodooAudio\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh\nMusic from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Mexico is a beautiful place to Scuba Dive, and Cozumel is one of the top scuba diving and snorkeling destinations in the Riviera Maya the Caribbean. It's unique for its drift diving, marine life, and beautiful dive sites. There are a few in particular, called Palancar Bricks, Palancar Gardens, and Palancar Caves. These sites are all part of Palancar coral reef, and are like swimming through a cathedral. Towers and caves of coral rise over you, and run beneath you. \n\nCozumel is a special island. During the day the big cruise ships, especially Carnival Cruises, unload thousands of people looking for Cozumel excursions. Most go shopping, but the smart few find a local dive shop and get on a boat. If you travel all this way and don't see underwater, you're missing the biggest draw to the island. \n\nI ended up doing a lot of dives here over the past couple years. When editing this video, it was hard for me to cut it into a few minutes for youtube. I settled on just cutting together the dive of Palancar Gardens. That's the dive site if you're curious!\n\nShout out to all my divers out there.

I had put it on my list of places to go exploring in the future. When we finally had a free day to check it out, I was shocked. No fences, no guards, no tape. It was an abandoned Gentlemen's Club... aka a strip club... right beside the busiest highway in Quintana Roo, Mexico. It had Urban Exploration written all over it.\n\nI always try to do my research before we do an adventure. The history is half the fun of the place. Every abandoned building has a story, and  love sharing it. However, there was nothing about this place online. I would guess it's over 30 years old, before the days of facebook pages and yelp reviews. It's condition is pretty great actually. Normally when you go urban exploring there is a ton of graffiti on these places. Not the case here. Hareem Gentlemen's Club by Playa del Carmen, Mexico does not exist on the web.\n\nBecause of it's proximity to big nightlife hubs like Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum, I had a suspicion there could have bee people living inside. Hunch confirmed.... but why the roof??\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nHere's Mariannela's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\nSexy Lounge - Soundsphere\nAbstract Glitch Melody - Sevenotes\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Dos Ojos Cenote is a magical place for scuba diving just outside of Tulum. It's one of the many Cenotes in the Yucatan Peninsula, and has a reputation for beautiful diving and snorkeling. Mexico is an incredible country and the entire Riviera Maya has so many unique and amazing dive sites. If you're not certified you're missing out. Half of the appeal of this part of the world is Underwater!\n\nTulum is not too far from Cancun or Playa del Carmen, you can take a collectivo (a local taxi van) for very cheap to travel along the coast. Once you're there, you can see a lot around the town, and there are several cenotes to visit. Taxi's aren't too bad once your there, and there are a lot of dive shops that will take you to the cenotes. I went with Infinity2diving, their info is a little bit lower on the list!\n\nI arrived here with the expectation of getting my Cave Diving certification, it turns out there is a type of diving called Cavern Diving. This means you never leave the guide line, and you always are able to see ambient light. This was enough for me, as on several of these dives we were well underground, with only a faint glow in the distance of sunlight. You have to be an advanced scuba diver to be allowed to participate in this type of dive. I highly recommend you get certified that high!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nMy Steadicam to keep things Balanced: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\nMy light setup Underwater!: http://itorch.ca/venom35s.html\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nMake sure to check out infinity2diving (http://www.infinity2diving.com/).

These are for hardcore travellers, ones that aren't afraid to dive deep into the cracks, and see things that I guarentee aren't in any other bali vlog in 2019.\n\nAs tourists flock to Kelingking beach, Nusa Penida, the Bali swing, and Canggu, there is a whole other side to this magical island in Indonesia. One that would satisfy even the wildest adventurer, and treads the line of Dark Tourism.\n\nHERE'S THE GEOTAGGED LIST ON TROVER:\nhttps://www.trover.com/l/6nRP2-bali%e2%80%99s-secrets\n\nThe app is free, and it's great to find hidden gems near your location. Check it out and give me a follow ;)\n\n1. The Sunken Temple Garden (Devata Vishnu)\nRumoured to be thousands of years old (it's not) these beautiful dive site is an artificial reef made to resemble a Hindu temple. It's located in the far west of Bali. I recommend visiting with Reef Seen Divers, the creators of the attraction.\n\n2.The Ghost Palace Hotel (Bedugul Taman Rekreasi Hotel)\nAn enourmous abandoned hotel right by the highway in the central part of Bali. For a sneaky dollar you can get in and explore this incredible place yourself. The view and intricately caved Naga statues make this place a wild adventure.\n\n3. USAT Liberty Shipwreck (Tulamben, Bali)\nTorpedoed by the Japanese, and sunk by a volcano in North Eastern Bali, this shipwreck is laying in shallow water. Very few places to you find ships this size, this close to shore. Even snorkelers can enjoy this massive steel cathedral. I've never seen anything like it.\n\n4. Goa Gajah (The Elephant Temple)\nJust a short distance from Ubud, Bali, this strange temple doesn't get many visitors. Its giant gaping mouth doorway is the main attraction. The photos are amazing.\n\n5. Trunyan Cemetery (Kuburan Terunyan)\nFor hundreds of years, the deceased of the nearby town of Trunyan have been laid open face at the base of a sweet smelling tree. Its said both smells cancel each other out. It's one of the most shocking things I've ever seen.\n\nJoin the Adventure Newsletter\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/join-our-adventure-newsletter\n\nPatreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\nEXPERIENCES OVER POSSESSIONS SHIRTS\nhttps://shop.fearlessandfar.com/\n\n#FearlessandFar #Bali #Indonesia\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSmall Camera: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nFlying Camera: https://geni.us/Travel_Drone\n\nLenses\nWide Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy Secret Weapon Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nMicrophone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nWind Shield: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nLOVE this thing (Sony): http://geni.us/PeakCaptureKit\nCamera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\nAll music from MusicBed.com\n\nGet a 30-day free trial of the best music for your videos.\nThey are my favourite site by far\n\n http://share.mscbd.fm/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "Exploring the ruined town of Belchite in Spain was one of the best memories I have of our travels through the country. Two towering abandoned cathedrals scarred with the bullet holes of a war long past. We arrived not knowing what to expect, but my mind was blown. It was an absolutely incredible adventure.\n\nBelchite means beautiful city, and it was one of the many casualties of the Spanish Civil war in 1937. This city was one of the very first to suffer the effects of an air raid, this type of warfare and just begun to see use, and you can see the results in the cathedrals. They are crumbling.\n\nLosing this town was hard for many people. It's beauty was remarkable. However, instead of repairing the city to its former glory, an new Belchite was built beside it, and the ruins continue to lay abandoned as a war memorial. Because of the thousands of lives that were lost here, it is considered one of the most haunted places in Spain, and they say the echos of war can still be heard in the walls. Scary stuff!\n\nIt turns out there are guided tours here. We just showed up and went with the flow. You can organize them at the local tourism office in New Belchite\n\nThis travel vlog was a lot of fun. The day was perfect for exploration, and the sunset was epic. We hope you enjoy this place. It was quite special!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nMariannela Cataño - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n “Golden Hour\" - Broke for Free\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Guerrero Mexico has always been on my list of places to go and things to see. The state is beautiful, and doesn't get too many visitors besides Acapulco. We spent a weekend exploring this area, and here is our list of top things to do in Zihuantanejo. \n\nThe Fish Market\nEvery morning at 7:30am down by the basketball court on Paseo del Pescador street, the fishermen lay our their catch for local restaurant owners to purchase for the day. It's a pretty busy spot that early in the morning, and makes for a great way to grab some good photos and start your day.\n\nThe Christ Statue\nPlaya las Gatas is one of the most famous beaches in Zihuatanejo. Here, you come relax and take in the setting sun over the Pacific, and enjoy a drink at any of the beach bars that line the coast. Just off the break water there is a hidden underwater statue of Jesus, with arms outstretched just a few meters below the surface. You can rent snorkels, masks, and fins. Swim out to the buoy attached to his arm and get a view of this interesting attraction \n\nPozoleria Santa Prisca\n\nEvery Thursday this restaurant opens to serve this extremely traditional soup to whoever is brave enough to wait in line. Even if you've tried it before... you have to try it here. This is some of the best Pozole I've had in Mexico. Chili, corn, chicken, it's delicious. You can make reservations to beat the line. We recommend doing it.\n\nEl Partenon de Negro Durazo\n\nThis abandoned party house was owned by a corrupt police chief who used tax dollars to build it. He picked a beautiful location overlooking Playa la Ropa, contructed a greek style mansion, called it El Partenon, and then went to jail a few years later. It is now in incredible shape after been abandoned for several decades, and worth checking out (by appointment). It really is a special and unique attraction\n\nMezcalerias\nOne of my absolute favourite drinks world wide is Mezcal. With thousands of varieties, a very interesting history, and lots of establishments devoted solely to it... You have to spend some time in one of the many mezcalerias in Zihuatanejo, Mexico.\n\nHope you enjoyed this video of the alternative things to do in Zihuatanejo\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a gift from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nExploring with Cody https://www.youtube.com/user/SirCodyBuffinton\n\nMariannela http://bit.ly/Mariann_YouTube \n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Water\" - OGROD\n\"Sun\" - OGROD\n\n\"Happiness\" - Funkyfella\n\n\"Atmospheric Elegant Beaty\" - FUGU VIBES\n\"Abstract Timelapse\" - FUGU VIBES\n\n\"Funky Gringo\" - Funkyfella\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Exploring Mexico is one of my new hobbies. The Panteon Ingles in Real del Monte, Hidalgo is an old British Cemetery... in Mexico. 200 years ago, there was a very famous British Mine nearby, many miners came from their home country to work here, and a special graveyard was built to accommodate them. There are many stories surrounding this place, and symbolism is scattered throughout. It's a great adventure for people who love urbex, or abandoned places.\n\nMy friend Lola told me about this location, and I visited with her and another of her friends. We had heard there was a caretaker we could speak to, and we did end up finding her there. Maria del Carmen Hernández Skewes (which... I had a hard time remembering) is now in charge of the Panteon, but her father was the one who received most of the fame. Don Chencho was made an official citizen of Britain by Queen Elizabeth II for his outstanding work taking care of the Cemetery during the time the mine was active, and now he is buried facing Britain (like all the other miners) in the Graveyard.\n\nIf you're wondering what some of the best things to do are around Pachuca, and urban exploration is interesting for you... this place is worth checking out. It's placed high on a hill looking over Real de Monte, with tall cedar and pine trees scattered throughout. It was really quite beautiful, in a slightly creepy way. I imagine it would be absolutely stunning at sunrise or sunset. I'd recommend to visit then, as you probably won't see a ghost ;) \n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n “Magic Castle\" - Kapoti Kapota\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

A large corn tortilla filled with beans, topped with Chapulines (grasshoppers), Cocopaches (beetles), Gusano de Maguey (big worms), Chiliquiles (little worms), escamoles (ant larvae) and a tasty little scorpion on top.\n\nMexican street food, especially the typical ones are very delicious. This restaurant is famous for using organic corn straight from the farmers, and you can taste the difference. Their Mexican cuisine is the best food around.\n\nTlacoyotitlan is a restaurant in colonia Santa Maria la Ribera in CDMX. In the centre of this neighbourhood there is a beautiful Kiosko where locals usually dance in the afternoon. This amazing restaurant in Mexico City is right beside this plaza and has some of the best Garnachas (Mexican street food), and best insect dishes I have had in the city.\n\nWould you give this a taste test?

They are not actually monkeys like many people believe, they belong to the ape family, and share a lot of their biology with us.\n\nWe spent 2 days cruising the rivers of Tanjung Puting National Park to see these animals. Many of them are rescues, taken back from the illegal pet trade. This allows us to see them up close, as they still have to be fed by humans. Indonesia is a paradise for nature geeks. These animals are basically like celebrities, and seeing them like this was an incredible experience.

Neither they, or their mothers who accompanied them had ever been on an airplane, or seen the ocean before. \n\nThe sea has always been at the centre of my life. I spent my childhood exploring it, I went to school to study it, and now I travel to film it. I can't imagine a life without ever seeing the ocean. Watching the kids react was absolutely amazing. They took fascination in how the sand fell out of their hands, how the waves curled into the shore, how salty the water was, and so many other things we just don't pay attention to as we grow up. \n\nThis was a special project for me, and it's part of the #todospodemosviajar (Everyone can travel) project. \n\nThanks for watching, and take a peek below at some of the resources!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n✎ Resources ✎\n\n➡ Movies.

Along the way we make a quick pit stop to try some Cachiri, a local fermented alcoholic beverage using Casava. Upon arriving at basecamp, we find a surprise.\n\nThe Venezuela Airforce was doing a tour of the small communities, at was at our lodge. A concert had been organized, and emotions were running high. Unfortunately we couldn't capture all the magic of this moment on camera, but you could feel the tension. People were sad and frustrated with the situation in Venezuela, and wanted the mess to end. The music provided hope and positivity to the group, and the speeches ended with \"This is my Venezuela\" the one with music, dance, and laughing. So it continued, and we were invited to join. \n\nSouth America knows how to party. Latino culture is one of my favourites, and the Venezuelans do it right. They were teaching us Reggaton, Salsa, Bachata... it was a crazy night, and a highlight for Lexie and I.\n\nOur hearts go out the the Venezuelan people. Myself and my travel companion Lexie Alford visited this beautiful place late 2018, with the mission to show another side of a country in crisis. We planned to show the beauty of the people, and the natural beauty of the country.\n\nThis is not a video about the current economical or political situation.

A stingless jellyfish lake in Berau Regency, Derawan, off of the island of Borneo (aka Kalimantan).\n\nThis isn't the only stingless jellyfish lake in the world. The most famous being in Palau and Siargao, Philippines. The jellies in all of these lakes are called stingless because there are no natural predators here, and they do not have the need for protection. The reality is though, they do in fact sting, but the stingers on their tentacles (called nematocysts) are too small to pierce the skin of people. If you're a small fish, or other creature... you're lunch.\n\nThere are 4 species of Jellies in this lake, and in this Indonesia Travel Vlog, we go exploring to find each of them.\n\nBig love to Wonderful Indonesia for hosting this trip!\nThis was part of the #TripOfWonders, and annual influencer trip where creators get together and explore Wonderful Indonesia\n\n#FearlessandFar #WonderfulIndonesia\n\nMy Behind the scenes content -https://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nCheck out Wonderful Indonesia here: https://www.indonesia.travel/\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\nSlow Motion - Plaincask\n\"Abstract Ambient\" - Micrah\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/fearlessandfar\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/fearlessandfar\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯",

        "description": "More exploring abandoned places! I teamed up with my friend Mariel de Viaje to visit some of the less known attractions in Chapultepec Park in Mexico City. This forest is huge. One of the biggest city parks in the Western Hemisphere, and has many many secrets.\n\nI had heard about the abandoned train station from before. Officially called \"El Tren Panoramico de Chapultepec\" it was abandoned in 2006 for unknown reasons. There are stories that there was an accident, there are also stories there was budget issues. Either way, these trains are just sitting there, rusting next to the highway very close to the Museum of Natural History. There is no fence, no signs, anyone can walk down and see them.\n\nThat being said, we tried that. 2 guards approached us and said we needed a permit to be there, and that wild dogs would attack us if we came back. So naturally, we rescheduled our visit for sunrise, to visit again. It worked.\n\nThe train station was creepy enough, not the most terrifying of all my urban exploration, but I couldn't deny it. What made the experience even more spooky was the pile of chicken heads on a burnt piece of grass, and the chicken organ next to the cross and saint inside.\n\nWhy was there here? The guard related it to the dogs, but we didn't see any. Also, none of the heads were chewed. It definitely doesn't explain the organs next to the photo inside either. Strange stuff. We made jokes about a Satanic Ritual, and summoning daemons from the underworld. Who knows though, something about it didn't add up. To me, It definitely looked like a sacrifice.\n\nA big thank you to Mariel's Husband Adrian as well, he helped us a lot these days!\n\nHope you enjoyed the video.

In this Tulum travel vlog I join my from Jordan from Drenched, and Sarah from Girls that Scuba, and night dive a cenote in search for crocodiles. Definitely one of the craziest things to do in Tulum, Quintana Roo!\n\nIf you are scuba diving in Tulum, Playa del Carmen, Cancun, Isla Mujeres, Cozumel or anywhere else in Rivera Maya, you'll be surprised by the diversity you can find on this coast. The reef diving is quite nice, especially in Cozumel, but in my opinion, the highlight is the many cenotes the dot the Yucatan Peninsula. \n\nThe freshwater sink holes have long been rumoured by the Mayan people to be the gateway to the Underworld. I'm not sure if that's true, but I know they are the gateway to phenomenal diving. KOOX diving offers an interesting tour if you're not faint of heart. Night scuba diving with crocodiles. How's that for wild things to do in Tulum!\n\nThe trick is that crocodiles, and other animals that can see at night, have reflective eyes. If you shine a flashlight in the dark, they reflect back some of that light towards you. This allows you to spot them immediately, where as in the day, they would remain heavily camouflaged.

        "description": "Scuba Diving in Riviera Maya Mexico is beautiful. Cancun, Tulum, Playa del Carmen, all have beautiful opportunities for diving and snorkeling, all quite close to shore. This particular coral reef is right beside MUSA, the Underwater Museum and in between the Cancun and Isla Mujeres. It's called Manchones Reef, and it's quite easy to travel to.\n\nThe amount of fish we saw at this place was crazy. There are some sculptures to see down there too. Especially the Cruz de la Bahia, or Cross of the Bay featured in the Thumbnail. We hopped on a ferry from Puerto Juarez in Cancun, and headed over to Isla Mujeres to dive with a dive shop called PocNa. They took us out on a few dive boats to see the best of the area. Scubadiving is one of the best things to do in the Yucatan Peninsula. Cenotes, Coral Reefs, Sharks, it has some of the best underwater experiences in the world \n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nMy Steadicam to keep things Balanced: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nBig thanks to Pocna Dive Hostel on Isla Mujeres helping create this video.

        "description": "Teufelsberg in Berlin is an abandoned United States NSA Listening Station just outside the German capital. After World War 2, thousands of tons of rubble had to be moved out of the city. They created a manmade hill, and named it Devil's Mountain. During the Cold War, the USA built a spy base on it's summit to listen to the radio communications of the Soviet occupied East Berlin, and surrounding Eastern Germany. Since the wall fell, it's been left in ruins and has become a haven for Graffiti Artists. At one time, you were able to just go. However now, there are people who tend to the area and fend off trespassers. There are still ways to visit Teufelsberg, make sure to check online first.\n\nIf you like graffiti, abandoned places, street art, or James Bond Moon Bases.... then put this on your bucket list. It's one of the most incredible things to do in Berlin, and there really isn't much else like it anywhere in the world. You can get there by taking the Bahn to Grunewald Forest in the West, you can also see the domes when flying to Berlin Airport.\nGoing to Teufelsberg, or already been? Message below and let's chat. I want to know if you made it in!

        "description": "Scuba diving Neptune Memorial Reef was at the top of my list of things to do when I landed in Miami, Florida. It's an underwater cemetery just off the coast, and a very cool and creepy dive site. If you'd like a burial at sea, you can have your ashes mixed with concrete. Then, you are formed into a small statue and sunk in the Atlantic Ocean to be part of the artificial reef. \n\nBy chance, I was in the area around Halloween, and jumped on a boat to experience one of the most unique dives of my life. Tarpoon Lagoon and Ocean Safari (Both PADI dive centres) were running a night dive on Neptune Memorial Reef to carve pumpkins. Spooky, Epic, Beautiful. It was amazing.\n\nFlorida state has some very impressive SCUBA diving, I wish I had more time to explore while I was there. I only had time for this experience, and Manatees further north. Florida is worth the travel time if you're a diver, so much to see!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\nTarpoon Lagoon: https://tarpoondivecenter.com/\nOcean Safari: http://www.oceansafari.com/\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\"Derevo\" - Elite Music\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "The Wakatobi Islands have some of the best Scuba Diving in Indonesia. It was amazing to be back in this place. I did my first big trip here 8 years ago! The name of the island chain comes the first two letters of each of the four islands. Wangi, Kaledupa, Tomia, and Binongko. We dove off the jetty in the island of Wangi, the \"Wa\" in Wakatobi. \n\nThese islands are in the middle of the Coral Sea, on of the three coral hotspots in the world. (The other two being the Caribbean and the Red Sea) Here, you can see an amazing amount of ocean life. The diversity and density is unmatched around the world. I'd recommend staying with a dive resort or live aboard and spending a few days here. It's incredible.\n\nWould love to go back and spend time diving some more sites!\nThis was taken on the #TripofWonders. A great project, with some great people!\n\nAnd guys, don't freedive after you dive. You can get bent.

Lexie Alford and I only had a couple days here before continuing to Turkmenistan, and I thought this would be a hilarious Fearless and Far journey to make my first and only Uzbekistan Travel Vlog. \n\nWe start off in Tashkent, the capital city of Uzbekistan, and drove to Beldersay, a tiny resort on the side of Mount Chimgan. We didn't know what to expect when we arrived there, but we found CHEAP rental prices and very little english.\n\nWe went to go Snowboarding in Uzbekistan, but my highlight was the group of middle age Uzbek women illegally sliding on plastic bags at the top. That and the view... the view was incredible.\n\nLexie and I got wrecked on the icy off-season slopes, snowboarding fails everywhere, but it was a helluva lot of fun.\n\nJoin the Adventure Newsletter\nhttps://fearlessandfar.com/join-our-adventure-newsletter\n\nExtra videos here:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fearlessandfar\n\n#FearlessandFar #Uzbekistan #Snowboarding\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nLexie Alford\nwww.instagram.com/lexielimitless\nwww.lexielimitless.com\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\nKazakh Dombra Epic Indent\n\n\"Good Morning\" - Lax City\n\"Always\" - Utah\n\"Color Run\" - Wessman Fade\n\nMusic from MUSICBED.

        "description": "The more I travel through Mexico, the more I love it. This is a small adventure just a few hours from CDMX. These are called the Prismas Basalticos and they are a series of waterfalls near the Pueblo Magico of Huasca de Ocampo in the state of Hidalgo. In English, they are called Basaltic Prisms of Santa María Regla, but I'm guessing that doesn't come up very often, because there can't be too many English Speakers that visit this place.\n\nThis type of rock is called Columnar Basalt, and it’s really rare. Some other famous locations with this type of stone is the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, and Fingal's Cave in Scotland. It’s caused when Lava cools very quickly and fractures. The phenomenon is called Columnar Jointing, and it's pretty damn cool.\nHere, a river eroded into a small canyon and revealed this hidden attraction underneath. It might not be at the top of the Must See list, but it's very beautiful. Especially if you into Geology, Landscape Photography, or Waterfalls. This is a unique combination of a lot of things.\n\nWe paid about 50 pesos each for an entrance fee, and you can see the whole place in about an hour, it’s not that big. I’d also recommend arriving really early or really late in the day. It was busy even though it was cloudy, but we basically had it to ourselves at 4pm\n\nThis is one of many things to do in this area. We also checked out a really cool viewpoint called Pena del Cuervo that was nearby:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twXYS_duaWo\n\nLike I said above, I’m constantly amazing by the wonderful, strange, beautiful places and things Mexico keeps surprising me with.

        "description": "This abandoned flour factory in Mexico City was sent to a Urbex friend of mine, La Catapixia, by one of his subscribers. We jumped at the chance to explore this place. On google maps it looked amazing, but we didn't know how to enter. The plan would be to show up and find out. It would be an adventure.\n\nThe story of this abandoned building is that it exploded. Pretty dramatic right? If you think about what a flour factory does, it would receive bulk shipments of wheat, and then use a grinder to pulverize it into powder for your baking pleasure! If the building had poor ventilation, this powder would hang in the air. Why is that a problem? Google \"Flour Explosion\" and you'll find out. Kaboom.\n\nThe history of this place is a bit confusing. We were told by a few sources it had been abandoned for 50 years, but found paperwork inside dated as recently as 2003. The guard there didn't know too much about the place, his job was to just chill and keep people out who didn't have permission. There's a lot of abandoned places around CDMX, this one seems to get very little attention despite being absolutely beautiful. The grain silos especially, so happy we brought the drone (DJI MAVIC) along to shoot them from the air. \n\nIt's been a while since I've posted an exploring vlog, but we've been doing a lot of filming as we travel around Mexico. Expect some more fun stuff soon. I love this country.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\nBig Love to my friends La Catapixia.

We met up with my friend Ale Ivanova, and I pulled all the East Coast Canada treats out of my closet for this special occasion. Not all of them are delicious, which made it a bit funny. That's the point of a challenge!\n\nI'm from the province of New Brunswick, and some of these are specialties from that area of the country. We call it the Maritimes, or Atlantic Canada. Here are the things we ate:\n\nChicken Bones - A Cinnamon and chocolate candy that people eat during Christmas.\n\nBloody Caesar - A Hangover drink with Clamato Juice (Clam+Tomato), vokda, and a bunch of other spices.\n\nDulse - A famous red seaweed that is dried on the shores of the ocean. Very salty, very fishy.\n\nMaple Cream - A block of maple sugar, which is usually soft. This one is expired.\n\nPoutine - aka Fat Salad. Maybe Canada's most famous dish. French Fries, Gravy, Cheese.... mmmmMmmmm\n\nDid I forget some Canadian Specialties? Did we like some that you don't?

I knew Exploring with Josh wouldn't be shy to make a gross food challenge video, so we went to the local taqueria, and loaded up on some of the most weird and disgusting tacos we could find.\n\nWe came home with some crazy ones... heart, brain, face, fat, ear, heart... and more. We decided to eat 4 on his channel, and 4 on mine. It was a lot of organ meat, more than I've had in my life, and we barely got it down.\n\nJosh's video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCP6ihfzCEI\n\nIt ended up pretty funny, we almost threw up eating a couple them. We had planned to eat the tacos for dinner, but ended up getting stuck in Mexico City traffic and returned home too late, we lost the daylight. We made the decision to film in the morning, I'm not sure if that was the best idea. Our reactions might have been a bit different.\n\nAlso, Josh had to get on a plane 2 hours later. We were betting he was going to end up puking in the airplane bathroom. He was all good though! I've done some spicy food challenges before, so I thought we'd try something a bit different in this vlog. What do you think? Would you try any of these nasty taco flavours?

People usually travel here for Mosquito Bay and it's bioluminescent water, but this particular dive site should be put on the list too. Turtles everywhere, and really unique! I was there early 2016 and loved it.\n\nIf you're looking for tours, activities, or things to do on Vieques for your holidays, there's actually quite a lot here. The island has a lot of old abandoned military infrastructure, and you can visit some very cool rusty chunks of history just off some of the main roads. \n\nAbandoned Bunkers. Trains covered in Vines. Old factories reclaimed by nature. I had a blast on this little island, and after a week of exploring, was sad to leave.\n\nSCUBA or a Snorkel are my favourite. Diving with Black Beard Sports was great. They seem to be leading the pack on the island for underwater adventures, and I highly recommend them.

        "description": "A new travel vlog series! A couple months ago, my friend and filmmaker buddy Caspar Diederik and I decided to take on a crazy challenge together.\n\nWe had finished a giant project in Germany together a few years ago, and never took that trip to celebrate the accomplishment. We decided to try something a little bit different, and sign up for a Adventure Challenge through the Amazon Rain Forest. 5 teams competed against each other for a week in the heart of the jungle. Swimming, Paddling, Hiking, Eating, every day was a new challenge. At the end, there was a winner.\n\nWe started off in the little town of Leticia in Colombia, then eventually crossed the border to both Peru and Brazil. I arrived a day late to begin the challenge, as I was trying to fly from Berlin to Leticia, and there were airport strikes in Europe. I made it to join on the night of day 1, and was greeted with a hell of a welcome party. Everyone was relaxing at a shaman's hut, trying Mambe and Rape. Powdered Coca leaves, and powdered tobacco. It was INTENSE, and gave you a huge head rush. The shaman sung as well all fell asleep that night in his giant hut. It was a great first night. The challenge started on day 2 for me, and that's where the story begins.\n\nThe company who ran this challenge is called Large Minority. They have a several amazing race style trips around the world. The Lanka Challenge in Sri Lanka, which teams race in Tuk Tuks around the country. The Cambo Challenge, which is a similar race around Cambodia, the Philippines Challenge, which is sailing, and the new addition was the Amazon Challenge.\n\nIt was a wild experience. Like I said at the end of the video. I thrive off adventures like this. Leaping out of your comfort zone, into the mud, allows you to come back home a better, more bullet proof version of yourself.\n\nDid we win? Did we lose? Stay tuuuuuuuuned!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nMy talented teammate, Caspar Diederik of Story Travelers, check out his films. He also shot some of the video featured in this series. https://www.youtube.com/user/StoryTravelers\n\nLarge Minority creates adventure challenges around the world. Philippines, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, and now the Amazon. This  was one of the most immersive organized experiences I've had. We were deep in the jungle and I loved every minute of it.

        "description": "Why aren't you travelling the world? What can you do today to get started? What's the problem? Money? Time? What's the excuse?\n\nI got some friends together and we created this video. Some of you may not like it, it might make you feel uncomfortable, that's ok. It might make you angry, and that we don't understand... that's ok too. For many of us we were once at that point too. We just want you to look at your excuses, and really ask yourself, are these real? \nI know that some of you have legitimate reasons, and some need to think twice. We hope that this will help a few people off the fence. Changing your attitude is the real way to travel the world.\n\nMany of life's obstacles can be overcome. Breaking goals down into small steps is how big dreams come true. A dollar a day in a bank account does more than make 30 dollars a month, it plants a seed that changes how you think. The idea behind this video is to give you some Motivation and Inspiration to make a change in your life. To join us.\n\nThere are hundreds of thousands of people making the sacrifices they need to, to be able to see the world. Why aren't you one of them?\n\nWe filmed this in Leipzig, Germany.

        "description": "This is a secret I've never told publicly. I'm sure many people won't believe it, but it's true. I was terrified to speak for most of my life.\n\nNow it's job is to speak on camera... every day... to millions of people. As an adventure travel YouTuber and travel tv host, Getting over this fear has been one of the biggest and most rewarding challenges of my life. I thought it was about time I made a video about it. I want to talk about a side of my life that few have heard about. \n\nI had just finished recording a Podcast called \"Living Vividly\" with the Guys from Vivid Roots. This inspired me to make a full length video about it.\n\nThose who spent the majority of their life silent, sometimes have more to say than everyone else. I feel that this is my case. A couple terrible events in my childhood really set me up for experiencing a lot of social anxiety in high school. Fear was part of my everyday life. \n\nBut what if you could change your relationship with that feeling?\nThe usual reaction to fear, is more fear. It's like a roaring fire, and we just add more and more to the flame. Our mind spins, we lose control and fear takes the wheel. It's not a good driver. It doesn't think about tomorrow, nor what's best for you, nor what your long term goals are.\n\nThrough travel, I was able to encounter experiences that allowed me to challenge the terror that was holding me back from being my best self. \n\nI wanted to share some of this motivation with you, in hopes you can make a more knowledgeable decision when you find yourself in a similar position.\n\nLet me know what you think of the inspirational video, let's all live a life that's free!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nLiving Vividly Podcast:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD0zJpla_Tw&t=\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Kryjowka\" - OGROD\n|\nhttps://soundcloud.com/ogrodmusic\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

We stumbled across these in Celaya, Guanajuato and I had to make a vlog about it. Trying strange street food is a hobby of mine. The weirder the better. I think we all need to try things once, including food.\n\nMexican Food is on the rise. With many popular chefs and travel TV hosts praising it's diversity and complexity far beyond Nachos and Burritos, it will be no time before it becomes world famous. I agree with them all.\n\nWe were visiting the Mexican state of Guanajuato to see the Mummy Museum (Museo de Momias), as well as the Exploding Hammer Festival near Celaya. As a fun little activity, we went to a market to learn how to make Gorditas, a Mexican street food whose main component is a stuffed corn tortilla. Beside this little gorditas stand was a lady selling strange things in jars. I was curious and asked. She then pulled out all kids of different feet... and I just had to try one and vlog it.\n\nHow did it taste?\n\nI think my reaction said it all. It was quite slimy and tasted a bit like sour stewed chicken. I realize it was pork, but I didn't really taste like it. How it melted into jello in my mouth made me react the way I did. Taste-wise ok. Texture-wise... Nasty. I don't think I would try it again!\n\nWould you?\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nCheck out my friend Ryan!

        "description": "Jump into 2018 with me as I show my Top 5 (+1) places I visited this past year. On Kick the Grind, we travel to strange, unique, and amazing places. We search out the best travel experiences, and I've picked my top recommendations for your travel plans this year.\n\nReal travel experiences are harder and harder to come by these days. I have to search pretty hard to find the gems. Big ups to Vice Magazine and Atlas Obscura for the inspiration this past year. These are all places to visit before you die, and some of the most amazing places I've come across in 2017.\n\n----\n\n#1 The Haro Wine fight\n\nAlso known as La Batalla de Vino, this crazy festival happens every year on June 29th in the small town of Haro in Rioja, Basque Country, Spain. For a little under an hour, locals pour hundreds of gallons of delicious Spanish red wine on each other to celebrate a Patron Saint.\n\nVIDEO LINK: NONE\n\n----\n\n#2 The Baby Jumping Festival\n\nSimply known as El Colacho to the locals of the small town of Castrillo de Murcia, Burgos, Spain. This cool festival involves a man dressed as a yellow devil whipping teenagers and jumping over newborn babies. On the surface it seems crazy and reckless... Who would ever put their baby on the street to be jumped over?\n\nThe reality is quite beautiful, and extra care is taken with the babies. When El Colacho (the devil) jumps over the baby, it is very similar to a baptism. The child is cleansed of the natural sin we are all born with, and it's a very exciting day for the family of the children.\n\nThe festival takes place on the first Sunday after Corpus Christi, so June 3rd in 2018\n\nVIDEO LINK: https://youtu.be/bXXgB06y5xU\n\n----\n\n#3 The Exploding Hammer Festival\n\nThis festival is unbelievable. Men strap homemade explosives on sledgehammers and slam them into a field of small rocks. They do this every February 28th in the tiny Mexican Town of San Juan de la Vega in Guanajuato, Mexico to celebrate John the Baptist.\n\nVIDEO LINK: https://youtu.be/vB9IdhcFAvY\n\n----\n\n#4 Toraja Regency Funeral Rites\n\nEasily one of wildest travel experiences. The Torajan people of Central Sulawesi have very incredible rituals and beliefs around death. \n\nWhen someone dies, they are simply called \"sick\" and are kept in the house of the family. They are still treated like they are very much alive. Food is bought to them, music is played, the family comes to ask them questions.\n\nWhen ready, the family has a extremely elaborate and expensive funeral to send them off to the afterlife. Experiencing this will change your life, and also your views on death.\n\nIf you'd like to see a Ma Ne'Ne, which is the opening of the coffins and is commonly called \"The Waking Dead Festival\" you have to visit in August or September. Also this is the time of year to see the Funerals. It is the best time to see these amazing funeral rites.\n\nVIDEO LINK: COMING SOON\n\n----\n\n#5 Nido De Quetzalcoatl\n\nEasily the Coolest AirBnn in Mexico (or maybe the world) this giant snake building is tucked into a small valley in Naucalpan, Mexico State. Javier Senosiain created this amazing structure while following his principles of Organic Architecture; building with natural shapes and forms, while respecting the surrounding environment. \n\nAirBnb Link: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10153978\n\nVIDEO LINK: COMING SOON\n\n----\n\n#6 Amazonian Traditional Medicine\n\nSlowly becoming mainstream is a big threat to experiencing real Amazonian Medicine with a legitimate shaman. As more and more people seek out these spiritual experiences, the more unqualified people want to take money from tourists. Asking locally is usually a better way to find what you're looking for. A friend and I went to Leticia, Colombia to find these experiences.\n\nRAPÉ AND AYAHUASCA VIDEO LINK: https://youtu.be/1BCwoAtW8Ak\nKAMBÔ VIDEO LINK: https://youtu.be/_ejHkW4yIyg\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Spectacular\" - Funky Fella\n\"Another Bang in the Universe\" - Funky Fella\n\"Spanish Fire\" - Garry Oneal\n\"Death Song\" - Traditional Torayan Music\n\"Happiness\" - Funky Fella\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh \n\"Bank Boats\" - Peter Sandberg\nfrom Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Eating strange foods while I travel has always been a guilty pleasure of mine. The more weird, slimy, gross, nasty ... the better.\n\nI think it's amazing that the locals think these things are normal. Who's to say who's taste buds are right?

Like 20 day old chicken left to dry on a car dashboard, then soaked in vinegar. My reaction was decent I think.\n\nMexico is an amazing place for street food. I would rank it equal to Thailand. On top of the 100 or so different street foods I've found so far, It seems there is no end the variations on each of them from state to state. Chicken feet was a brand new one I associated with Asia beforehand. \n\nMexico you always surprise me.

        "description": "Los Cabos is much more than it seems! Cajafresca and I were sent on a mission to vlog and explore the natural side of Baja California Sur, Mexico. This area is world famous for all-inclusive hotels, partying, and over consumption of tequila. We vowed not to get distracted by the obvious fun, and explore the world famous natural attractions; Whale Watching, Bird Watching, Snorkeling with Whale Sharks... Tons of stuff to do. This trip was an adventure.\n\nBig love to Grupo Presidente, Interjet, and the Holiday Inn Los Cabos for creating this project for us. Awesome brands to check out.\n\nFirst stop was bird watching and exploring Estero San Jose which was right beside our hotel (here: https://bit.ly/HIRLosCabos) I was amazed how many species there are here! It's a very important stopping point for many of the migratory species travelling from Northern North America, to the south. There were quiet a few Canadian birds I recognized as well. This was cut short by a turtle sighting. My personal highlight\n\nWhale watching was incredible. I've had been a few times in Canada, but this was one of the best experiences I've had with these animals. Since the Gulf of California is basically a crack in the earth, the beaches drop off very quickly into the depths. Whales can get very close to shore allowing awesome viewing (even from the beach) We went near Cabo San Lucas, wish I could have spent more time there.\n\nSwimming with Whale Sharks was almost an extreme sport. They are the biggest fish in the world, and they eat plankton, one of the smallest. They move deceptively fast despite their slow movements.

        "description": "This beautiful abandoned town is one of many located on the banks of the Yesa Reservoir in Northern Spain. Constructed sometime in the 11th or 12th century, Esco ( or Escó) was abandoned 50 years ago because of the decision to dam a nearby river.\n\nExploring this location was on my urbex wish list, the bright blue water, and crumbling cathedral caught my eye, and I was hoping we could head that direction and make a travel vlog about it.\n\nWhen we arrived to the ruins, we found exactly the experience we were looking for. No one was there, and we could explore in peace. Generally these places have a scary, or haunted vibe to them. Esco was peaceful, beautiful, and completely in ruins. \n\nEvery house was abandoned except one, where a local sheep farmer had repaired one enough to live in. A man alone, living in a ghost town.\n\nThis abandoned city was a wild adventure. Soooo happy we could get into the tower. It made the trip. What do you think? Should I have walked on the wooden floor?\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nMariannela Cataño - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\nTyler and Bailey - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYYak6fSy-M1Ybvf9t3qJ3A\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n “Lonely\" - Luca Francini\n\n “Solitude\" - Broke for Free\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Manta Rays, Whoa. This was shot while SCUBA diving in Nusa Penida, Bali, Indonesia. There's a great dive site called Manta Point. We saw 8 Rays! Since I can remember, this animal has been at the top of my wish list. They didn't disappoint, it was a helluva show. I was staying in Sanur on mainland Bali, and met up with Blue Season Bali to take the boat together. You can stay on Nusa Penida, or Nusa Lembongan, but most dive shops leave from the mainland, as the sites really aren't much closer if you stay on the other two islands.\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nSony Alpha a7S Digital Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony 16-35mm FE F4 ZA OSS: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 55mm F1.8 Sonnar T FE ZA: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nSony FE 90mm f/2.8-22 Macro G OSS: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\n\nRode VideoMic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nSanDisk Extreme PRO 64GB SD Card: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nPD Capture Camera Clip: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPD Capture Lens Kit: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPD slideLITE Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPD Rain Shell Cover: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\n3 Legged Thing Carbon Fiber Tripod:: http://geni.us/Tripod\nGlidecam HD-2000 Steadicam: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nDJI Phantom 3 4K Drone: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\nMy light setup Underwater!: http://itorch.ca/venom35s.html\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nBig love to Blue Season Bali for putting me on a few boats.

        "description": "After eating some amazing traditional Mexican Food with Dan of The New Travel, we went for dessert... Escamole ice cream aka ant egg ice cream at Tlacoyotitlan. Mexican sweets and Mexican dessert are usually delicious. We weren't sure about this one!\n\nTlacoyotitlan is a restaurant in colonia Santa Maria la Ribera in CDMX. In the centre of this neighbourhood there is a beautiful Kiosko where locals usually dance in the afternoon. This amazing restaurant in Mexico City is right beside this plaza and has some of the best Garnachas (Mexican street food), and best insect dishes I have had in the city.\n\nIn the previous video, The New Travel and I, had the Huarache Ancestral. A large corn tortilla filled with beans, topped with Chapulines (grasshoppers), Cocopaches (beetles), Gusano de Maguey (big worms), Chiliquiles (little worms), escamoles (ant larvae) and a tasty little scorpion on top.\n\nWhat do you think? Would you give ant egg ice cream a taste test? I wouldn't say it's the best ice cream I've ever had, but was really surprised by the experience. It was pretty damn good!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nCheck out Dan: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwzfmK3YWOGPjrF0UDvzQ-Q/\n\nAnd Mariannela: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLsdv9V82CHVVEw5QP-OSow\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ LINKS TO GEAR HERE ϟ\n\nCameras\nSony a7s Cameras: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nSony RX100 V: http://geni.us/SonyRX1005\nGoPro Hero 5: http://geni.us/GPHero5\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/MavicFlyMore\n\nLenses\nSony 16-35mm f/4 : http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nSony 90mm f/2.8 http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nSony 55mm f/1.8:  http://geni.us/Sony55mm\nRokinon 24mm f/1.4: http://geni.us/Rokinon24mm\nCanon 70-300mm: http://geni.us/CanonZoomLens\nPhone Fisheye + Macro Lenses: https://pixter.fr/#IN42\n\nCamera Accessories\nCPOL for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenCPOL1\nVariable ND for Sony 16-35mm: http://geni.us/TiffenVarND\nRODE Videomic Pro: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nRODE Dead Cat: http://geni.us/DeadCatVMP\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\nZhinyu Crane Gimbal: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nPEAK Camera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nPEAK Lens Switching: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nPEAK Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nPEAK Keeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n3 Legged Thing Tripod: http://geni.us/Tripod\n\nGet a gift from PEAK DESIGN with my link: \nhttps://www.peakdesign.com?acc=721\n\nOther Accessories\nTravel Tea Mug: http://geni.us/TravelTea\nPowerbank: http://geni.us/AnkerPowerbank\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\nFunky Fella - \"Like A Red Rag To A Bull\" and \"Funky Gringo\"\n\nhttps://soundcloud.com/funky_fella\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

Three Sisters Springs is one of the only places in the world you can swim with these beautiful Sea Cows. I connected with River Ventures and my friend Kiersten of The Blonde Abroad and we made the trip. It was a beautiful underwater experience. You've got to try swimming with Manatees, I never thought we'd be able to get so close!\n\nIt's quite a special place actually. Besides the fact that hundreds of these animals huddle in this area to stay warm in the winter, it's the only place in the USA where you are legally allowed to swim with them. We had a kickass time. Would love to go back, this was shot during the off season, and there was no issue finding them. With cold water, there would have been many many more.\n\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nMy Steadicam to keep things Balanced: http://geni.us/Glidecam\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nKiersten's Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheBlondeAbroad\n\nWe went snorkeling with River Ventures.

        "description": "Xcalak, Mexico is a bit far off the beaten path. While quite close to Tulum, Playa del Carmen, and Cancun, rarely do tourists venture further south than the cruise ship town of Mahahual.\n\nWhen you get to this sleepy beach town, you'll realize there's not too much there. A few tiendas selling groceries, a taco shop, and also... one of the nicest PADI dive shops I've ever seen.\n\nI had watched a few videos of swimming with Crocodiles and Sailfish, scuba dives I didn't think you could do in Mexico, also I had my eye on diving a remote island reef called Banco Chinchorro. I investigated how to do each, and they all traced back to XTC diveshop in Xcalak.\n\nDuring this time of year (April) the main attraction was diving with Tarpon, a huge 2 meter long silver-sided fish, that is often quite a trophy for fishermen. Here, fishing was off the table, but diving with these giants was in full season\n\nDuring my stay here I ended up diving the site twice, as well as many other surrounding dive sites. This is one video of a few showcasing the diving in and around Xcalak and Banco Chinchorro. \n\nThoughts on what I said at the end of the video? How much more diving do you want to see on this channel? Should I make a second one?\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\nBig love to XTC Dive Centre for sending me out on a few dives.

I'm always trying to search out the strange and unique activities, but I had never heard a whisper of this one before. \n\nWhen I arrived to meet Andy Craven, I overlooked the man with the kayaks completely, and continued to drive around looking for a guy with surfboards, all I knew I was doing that morning was \"surfing\".\n\nThis day turned out to be one of the most fun I've ever had on the water. It's not an easy sport, but it's a ton of fun. We dressed up in wetsuits, rain jackets, helmets and life jackets and proceeded the paddle headfirst into a pretty big swell. Within the first 5 minutes we flipped, but that turned out to be a big part of the fun. Getting tumbled and flipped by the ocean was such a wild ride, and when we did end up catching waves it just felt like a bonus.\n\nThis HAS to go on your bucketlist if you are an adventure lover. We had a complete blast!\n\nLearn more about this area of Scotland: http://bit.ly/KtG_Scotland\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal \nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nAndy Craven\nhttp://andycraventraining.blogspot.mx/\n\nhttp://www.wildaboutargyll.co.uk/\nhttps://www.visitscotland.com/\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n“Sunrise\" - b7official\n\"As Colourful As Ever\" - Broke for Free\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Heyhey!\n\nI've teamed up with my friends at diveandmore.com to offer an 8-day underwater filmmaking workshop in Quintana Roo, Mexico.\n\nWe'll be launching June 30th 2018 from Cozumel, and during this time we'll be scuba diving it's towering coral reefs, then heading to the mainland to explore cenotes, the Mayan gateways to the underworld, and finally swimming with whale sharks along the coast.\n\nI've been diving for 10 years, and spent the last 6 years as a professional travel filmmaker. On top of all the incredible diving, I'll be teaching you my tips and tricks on how to make better travel videos though 3 1-hour lessons, and private one on one's. \n\nIf you aspire to be an adventure travel vlogger, a youtuber, a scuba filmmaker, or just edit something awesome to show your family and friends... there's no doubt you'll pick up a useful skillset to be able to do any of the above.\n\nI absolutely love Mexico, especially the underwater world. I moved to the country a year ago, and can't wait to share it with you.\n\nLooking forward to seeing you in Cozumel!\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nSign up is here: http://diveandmore.com/upcoming-dive-trips/underwater-video-workshop/\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",

        "description": "Hey yo!\nI haven't done one of these in a while, and this one I'm excited about!\nI'm teaming up with some friends - Grupo Presidente, Interjet, and Ale Ivanova. We're joining forces with Illuminemos de Azul por el Autismo to make some dreams come true. Three kids and their parents will be given a trip from Mexico City to Cozumel to see the ocean for the first time. Life for these families is tough, the children have all been born with Autism, and the parents have to work very hard for little money to help support their condition. It's not too much to say that there's a chance they could live their entire life without ever seeing the ocean. \n\nI can't wait to show them something that is so powerful in my life. The sea means an incredible amount to me, and I cannot imagine a life without it. I'm honoured to be working with these great people to make dreams come true. \n\nCan't wait to share :)\n\n---------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n♥ Friends ♥\n\nAle Ivanova: https://www.youtube.com/aleivanova\n\nwww.facebook.com/interjet\nwww.facebook.com/iluminemosdeazulorg\nwww.facebook.com/InterContinentalCozumelResort\nwww.Facebook.com/GPresidente\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here:\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­----------------",

        "description": "I've been gone for a bit!\nInstead of waiting for Wednesday to jump back on the weekly videos, I thought I'd update everyone with what's coming up in the next few weeks. \n\nIt's been a wild past month... Mexico, Germany, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and now I'm back and just recovering from a Malaria scare. I'll take the Flu with a smile!\n\nSo, let's quit the chit chat. Coming up next on Kick the Grind!\n\nKambó - Traditional medicine from the Brazilian Amazon. Warriors and hunters used to do this to prepare for the hunt/war. It also supposedly gives your immune system a huge jolt and makes you more beautiful. Also... it makes you extremely sick.\n\nThe Mummies of Guanajuato - Seriously one of the most morbid and creepy places I've been. (And you know from this channel I've seen some pretty wild stuff around the world) The mummies of the Mexican state have a crazy story!\n\nThe Amazon Challenge - My friends over at Large Minority Adventure Challenges set us up with a one week race through the amazon rainforest during rainy season. It was intense, and one of the best experiences I've had in South America. I vlogged my way through it.\n\nGetting a Sleeve Tattoo - A couple years ago I decided I wanted to do this. It took me several years to decide what I wanted, find the right artist, and also be in one spot long enough to complete it. It takes 30-40 hours over several months to finish a sleeve. I made it happen in Mexico City\n\n____ _____ - A very difficult to access abandoned location in Mexico City. I met a new friend La Catapixia (check out his urbex channel) and he got us in. We have to keep it secret for a few weeks. Shhhh.\n\nAs always that you all so much for the love and support. The channel has grown so much in the past year, and as it does so, it allows me to show you more and more amazing things around the world. \n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\nϟ My Camera Gear ϟ\n\nMain Camera: http://geni.us/MyCamera\nMy Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony1635mm\nMy 2nd Favourite Lens: http://geni.us/Sony90mm\nLow Light/Portrait Lens: http://geni.us/Sony55mm\n\nLove this Microphone: http://geni.us/RODEMic\nMy SD Cards: http://geni.us/SanDiskPRO\n\nCamera Clips: http://geni.us/PDClip\nCool Gadget to switch Lenses: http://geni.us/PDLensKit\nMy Camera Strap: http://geni.us/PDStrap\nKeeping Safe on Rainy Days: http://geni.us/PDRainShell\n\nGreat Tripod with a Funny Name: http://geni.us/Tripod\nThis new Gimbal I love: http://geni.us/NewGimbal\nMy Flying Camera: http://geni.us/DJI4K\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n♫ Music ♫\n\n\"Getting Tipsy 2\" - Martin Landh from Epidemic Sound (http://www.epidemicsound.com)\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n☎ Say Hi Here ☎\n\n✧ Snapchat: kickthegrind\n\n✧ Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/kickthegrind\n\n✧ Tweetz: http://www.twitter.com/KickTheGrind\n\n✧ Facebook Fanpage: http://www.facebook.com/KicktheGrindTV\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------\n\n✯ Experiences over Possessions ✯ Kick the Grind ✯\n\n----------------------------------------­­­--------------------------------------­-­-­---------------",
