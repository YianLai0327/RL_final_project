I had no idea what the future had in store, but I knew that I had a passion for travel and a love for filmmaking so I decided to take these next few years to whole heartedly pursue this crazy dream of mine. In 8 months, I have seen, done and accomplished more than I have in my entire life. There have been countless sleepless nights, but I'm kept motivated by my desire to be the best at the job I love.

        "description": "This is the side of the elephant tourism industry they don't want you to know about. If you are planning to travel to South East Asia and Thailand for a vacation or your gap year, please be careful where you spend your money. One thing is certain, when traveling you will see businesses for elephant treks, elephant rides, and elephant shows where elephants play soccer, paint, and do unnatural tricks. Rather than getting that picture for Instagram or social media of you riding an elephant, consider choosing to spend your money at sanctuaries where the elephants are able to live and behave more naturally. If the tourist money is flowing to nature reserves and elephant rescues instead of rides and shows, the market will change itself and life will improve for these gentle animals.\n\nThis film was made in collaboration with the amazing @blakedavey\nhttp://www.blakedavey.com/\nHuge thank you to Lek with Elephant Nature Park\nGet involved: https://www.saveelephant.org/\nThank you to Leanne Fogarty with Elephanatics\nhttps://elephanatics.org/\nThank you to PETA for the Phajaan (Elephant Crush) footage\nhttps://www.peta.org\n\nSee more of what I'm up to\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/lostleblanc\nFacebook LostLeBlanc\nTwitter LostLeBlanc\nSnapChat LostLeBlanc\n\nSongs:\nAll Music used is from this website.

In just 3 days, we went from strangers to really good friends. We shared so many hilarious moments off camera and I legitimately left this trip believing this wouldn’t be the last time we traveled. \n\nSocial media is a weird place where it's always about \"growing\" your following and it’s easy to see everything as numbers. This trip was a powerful reminder that behind every subscriber, is a person. \n\nI know things have grown around here and sometimes you might think your comments go unnoticed but they really don’t. I read almost all the comments and feedback and I appreciate every bit of it.

        "description": "We we're invited on the opportunity of a lifetime as we joined the rescue of 2 abused elephants. We drove 12 hours to Surin which is near the border of Cambodia to free 2 elephants from a lifetime of abuse and slavery. This vlog is sad. There is no way around it. There are a lot of issues in the elephant tourism industry but they are issues that must be talked about. Please tell your friends and family to only support elephant sanctuaries. Businesses that allow these animals to act naturally as possible. Tomorrow's vlog will be all about bringing these two elephants to their new home!\n\nENP is an elephant rehabilitation center in Chiang Mai Thailand that takes in abused elephants and gives them a second chance at life. When you visit Thailand, make sure you are supporting the right businesses. Elephant Nature Park is definitely one of them.\n\nThis vlog will make you SMILE :)  - Elephant Nature Park Sanctuary\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NzygnKWG_g\n\nIf you didn't know already, this trip to Thailand is for an upcoming project by the name of Black Tusk. Black Tusk is going to be a short documentary (25-30 minutes) and it will showcase the abuse elephants in SE Asia face due to the tourism industry and it will promote socially responsible alternatives to Elephant trekking such as Elephant sanctuaries. The idea is, tourists need to co-exist with these beautiful animals instead of exploiting them and we need your help to share this message.\n\nBlack Tusk Info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PLm2a6LfCk\n\nSeptember 26, 2016\n\nInstagram LostLeBlanc\nSnapChat LostLeBlanc\nTwitter LostLeBlanc\nFacebook LostLeBlanc\n\nCheck out Blake @blakedavey\n\nSong:\nEhrling - Clouds\nNostalgia - Dominant \n--------------------------------------\nFAQ:\n-What camera and equipment do you use? \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuq50cVSFbw\n-What do you use to edit your videos?

I sold my beloved little VW car that was older than I am and I said goodbye to my friends and family because I was headed out into the wild with no clear directions.\n\nThat month was CHALLENGING. My whole life had just been flipped upside down. Even though I often didn't let it show, I was fighting a serious internal battle. To be honest, I was afraid I was making a mistake. I was trying to remain confident in my decision while the whispers of friends and family told me to turn back. I tried to stay confident in my business idea even though I had NO IDEA if it would work.\n\nWell, just a couple months in and I started to see the benefit of having my first break-even month (when you earn as much as you spend). In less than a year, I was able to become profitable as a business saving a few thousand dollars as a content creator. And today, just a few years down the road, and I now make the same amount of money in a good week as I would have in a whole year at my 9-5 job. And all while doing I something I love. I will forever be grateful to the young me that decided to risk it for the biscuit.\n\nJanuary 2016 was one of the most important moments in my life, and TODAY, March 1st 2020 will be one of the most important in YOURS.\n\nAs you think about what your life will be like after LCA, odds are good you feel the same internal battles I did back in 2016. Fear of failure, fear of judgement, and uncertainty of your upcoming path.\n\nLet me tell you this. When you join the Lost Creator Academy, I will equip you with the knowledge, strategy and skills to be successful as a content creator so you will remain in control of your path. I will personally support you through the uncertainty and fears until you naturally find your confidence. If you fight through the fear, in just a few weeks or months, it will go away and you will be made stronger because of it. If you refuse to compromise your dreams for your friends and family, with time, they will come to respect your decision. And if you embrace the uncertainty of this journey, opportunity WILL present itself to you.\n\nThrough the best mentorship, resources, and a ton of hard work, you will find your place in this industry and it all starts right here.",

So I did what everyone told me not to. \n\nI QUIT. \n\nWith $2500 to my name, I booked a 1-way ticket to Asia to try and find a way to make a career through travel and filmmaking. The problem was, I had no idea how to make a video. But I kept trying and eventually… It actually worked. The last 10+ years of my life have taken me to 100+ countries, 1000+ flights and each step of this journey was recorded and shared with you. \n\nThis is the story of an exceptionally average dude who never gave up.\n\n🔔 𝗦𝗨𝗕𝗦𝗖𝗥𝗜𝗕𝗘 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗧𝗨𝗥𝗡 𝗔𝗟𝗟 𝗡𝗢𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡𝗦 𝗢𝗡 𝗧𝗢 𝗦𝗘𝗘 𝗡𝗘𝗪 𝗩𝗜𝗗𝗘𝗢𝗦!\nhttps://youtube.com/lostleblanc",

So I did what everyone told me not to. \n\nI QUIT. \n\nWith $2500 to my name, I booked a 1-way ticket to Asia to try and find a way to make a career through travel and filmmaking. The problem was, I had no idea how to make a video. But I kept trying and eventually… It actually worked. The last 10+ years of my life have taken me to 100+ countries, 1000+ flights and each step of this journey was recorded and shared with you. \n\nThis is the story of an exceptionally average dude who never gave up.\n\n🔔𝗦𝗨𝗕𝗦𝗖𝗥𝗜𝗕𝗘 𝗔𝗡𝗗 𝗧𝗨𝗥𝗡 𝗔𝗟𝗟 𝗡𝗢𝗧𝗜𝗙𝗜𝗖𝗔𝗧𝗜𝗢𝗡𝗦 𝗢𝗡 𝗧𝗢 𝗦𝗘𝗘 𝗡𝗘𝗪 𝗩𝗜𝗗𝗘𝗢𝗦!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/lostleblanc",

        "description": "Unlike all my other videos, this was NOT filmed on my Gopro. We purchased the raw footage off a dive videographer because PADI forbids students to bring their cameras with them while they are learning to dive (makes sense since there is a lot going on when first learning).\n\nIt has been one of the best experiences I have had on my trip and I HIGHLY recommend that you try out scuba diving if you're considering it. It can be expensive to get your PADI or SSI but it is an experience like none other.\n\nYour dive certification allows you to legally dive anywhere in the world. Koh Tao is not the worlds best dive spot but it is a great one and a cheap one! I have since dived in the Philippines (Video coming soon) and the wildlife there was much more impressive. My next dive will be in Bali next week!\n\nInstagram.com/christian_leblanc",
