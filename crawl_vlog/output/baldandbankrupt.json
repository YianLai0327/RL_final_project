Ukrainians, Estonians, Kyrgyz etc. were taken from their homes and sent north in box cars to the camps to work away their stretches. Millions passed through the camps and many never returned home. Those camps have long been dismantled or converted into regular factories and work places and you'd be hard pressed to know that you were visiting a former camp. However Perm 36 logging camp has been preserved and so I travelled to the very edge of Europe to a village called Kutchino to visit the last Gulag and to see how the prisoners lived.",

So distant and yet so modern and futuristic. I'm no different and have always wondered what the country was like however what really intrigued me was what it had to offer beyond the huge metropolis of Tokyo. Was the whole country wealthy and modern and full of robot restaurants and Harijuku fashionistas? Or were the provinces something else? A place that suffers from the same economic and social problems that much of the rest of the world does? Well to find out I set off across Japan with my mate @BackpackerBen to see for ourselves, choosing a random town called Itaigowa from the map. What we found was not the Japan we knew existed.\n\nJoin us because I think we're turning Japanese, I really think so...\n\nThanks to Chris from @AbroadinJapan for all his advice behind the scenes.

This was a period when gangs protected by tough sambo fighters and boxers from the different republics began to form and to exploit the new riches that were to be found in the burgeoning capitalist era. One of those gangs was known as the Vilnius Gang which had a fierce reputation in Lithuania and further afield. \n\nI have always been fascinated by that short period of history and how those gangs operated and so when I was invited into a former member of the Vilnius Gang's home, well I of course accepted. Fortunately my bodyguard @JohnnyFD was with me. This would possibly be the night he would earn his usual $7 fee.\n\nThanks to everyone at Azerai cafe in Vilnius who allowed us to film the evening ( best food in Vilnius and Soviet vibes ) and huge thanks to Tadeus and Anastasia for their hospitality and the Soviet presents.

        "description": "🇱🇹 Since Lithuania gained it's independence in 1991 it has removed as much of its Soviet past as it possibly could unlike in other post-Soviet republics where there are constant reminders of the USSR around every corner. However in the north of the country lies the town of Visaginas where I was told I could find the last remaining Soviet mosaic ( kind of ). Join me as I head north to see how life is in Visaginas which was built to house the workers from the nearby atomic power station and maybe meet some babushkas on the way. \n\nCheck out @JohnnyFD's channel here: http://youtube.com/johnnyfd",
