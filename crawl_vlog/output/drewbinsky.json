This is one of the most surreal stories I’ve ever told you in my 7-year career as a YouTuber, and I can’t wait for you to watch it! \n\nI first heard about Mr. Thai Ngoc many years ago, and I never knew it would be possible to find him because his location has never been revealed.  \n\nMr. Ngoc claims that he hasn’t slept a wink since 1962 (the year my dad was born) - seriously! Some people think it could be PTSD from the war, while others believe that he has an extremely rare medical condition. Whatever the case is, I traveled 2 days from Arizona to a small village in South Vietnam to track him down, stay up all night with him, and see if it was actually true that he doesn’t sleep.  \n\nWhat I discovered is astonishing.

I just flew from Madrid to Amsterdam and back to Madrid in the same day, just to spend a few hours with The Iceman (Wim Hof) in his countryside home. \n\nI did my first-ever ice bath, and words cannot express how powerful this experience has been!\n\nWim Hof has spent his entire life defying reality by immersing himself in freezing temperatures, solely for the ability to control his mind to live a stress-free life. \n\nHe developed the \"Wim Hof Method,\" which is practiced by millions of people around the world. It uses a combination of breathing, meditation, and gradual cold exposure to train your brain to get rid of any mental disorders such as anxiety, depression, and fear. \n\nThe Ice Man has 26 Guinness World records, for mind-blowing things such as running marathons, barefoot, in the snow, staying in constant contact with ice for almost 2 hours, and hiking 7,200 meters high on Mt. Everest without pants on.\n\nThis guy is one of the most inspiring human beings on the planet, and it has been an honor to meet him. \n\nWim Hof wants his voice to be spread as far and wide as possible, so if you find his message inspiring, then please share this video with your friends!

It's a story that I've been wanting to tell for 7 years, and finally, I DID IT! \n\nPapua Island is a wild place, to say the least.  In many ways, it's considered 'the last frontier' in terms of off-the-beaten-path places on earth.  And I went there completely alone, in search of the world's last humans who eat other humans.  It's the last known place on earth to have this kind of bizarre culture and tradition. \n\nPapua Island is (politically) split into two halves.  The Western half is a part of Indonesia, while the Eastern half is Papua New Guinea, an independent country.  I showed up in West Papua, all alone, and had to figure out how I was going to travel deep into the jungle to meet the tribe. \n\nAfter a massive logistical nightmare (see my BTS video on my 2nd channel linked above), I ended up making it to the tribe where I spent 2 days, and it was absolutely incredible to learn about their unique way of life. \n\nI'd love to hear your feedback on this story because my team and I put A LOT of time, effort, and energy into it -- and I think it's the future for this channel. If you are reading this, I am doing a contest where the 'most liked' or creative comment will win a prize - so feel free to share your thoughts!\n\nI love you guys, and cheers to the first video of 2023!

Southern hospitality.  \n\nI spent 24 hours driving alone through America's poorest region, called McDowell County. It's a place where the minimum household income is less than $29,000 USD, and where ghost towns have been left behind in the aftermath of a booming coal industry. \n\nIn many respects, this is the forgotten America—a place where time has seemingly stood still. Yet, the narratives you’ll encounter here are among the most compelling I’ve ever told, anywhere in the world.\n\nI've been telling travel stories since 2017 - more than 1,200 videos - and about 97% of them have been overseas.

Yes, more than Afghanistan, Somalia, Libya, Syria and Iraq COMBINED.\n\nI've never experienced before what I just experienced in Haiti... 80% of the city is controlled by violent street gangs, and when we crossed the sketchy checkpoint to enter the biggest slum called Cite Soleil, we had to get permission from the gang-leading chief to enter.  I can't make this stuff up.\n\nI'm just glad that I made it out alive and am here to tell this story.  My heart aches for the people in Haiti, who are living through this disastrous situation.  I hope the country will return to its thriving days like it was a few decades ago. There is so much potential with stunning beaches, smiling faces, and Caribbean vibes. \n\nThanks for watching - it took my team of 4 and myself more than 3 weeks to get this story edited. My hope is that this video sparks conversations that contribute to a broader understanding and, ultimately, a positive change for the future of Haiti.\n\n#haiti #dangerous #travel \n\n✅ SUBSCRIBE for More Travel Videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n📝 Get My Top 100 Travel Pics FREE! https://bit.ly/3Fsk0qo\n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

        "description": "In this eye-opening story, I explore the lives of the Swartzentruber Amish - the most conservative subgroup of Old Order Amish. They arguably lead the most conservative and traditional lives of any humans on our planet. I gotta say, even after visiting all 197 countries in the world, I found the Swartzentruber Amish to be among the most fascinating groups of people I've come in contact with.  And it's in my own country!\n\nThrough my friend Lizzie, a former Swartzentruber Amish who grew up in Holmes County, Ohio, I gained rare access to this secluded community that is off-limits to outsiders.  Join me as we learn first-hand from the Swartzentruber Amish, as well as get a deep dive into Lizzie's childhood as she remembers it. \n\nNowadays, Lizzie is an incredible entrepreneur and runs her own business in the health & wellness industry. You can follow her journey on the links below:\n- IG: https://www.instagram.com/lizzieens_wellness\n- YT:@lizzieenswellness\n- Get her newly launched book! https://amzn.to/3LfyxaP\n\nHere's a little more information on the Swartzentruber Amish:  They are renowned for their extreme adherence to tradition and rejection of modern conveniences. They maintain the strictest rules regarding technology, shunning electricity, indoor plumbing, and even bicycles. Their church services are marathon-like, often lasting up to six hours, emphasizing their deep spiritual devotion to God.\n\nWhat makes the Swartzentruber Amish even more fascinating and shocking is their commitment to living without modern healthcare, relying solely on traditional remedies and community support. They also practice rigorous schooling and they complete education at the 8th grade, focusing instead on practical skills and Amish traditions.  \n\nI'd love to hear from you guys! Let me know your thoughts on this story in the comments down below - do you agree or disagree with the Swartzentruber Amish way of life?\n\n#usa #travel #ohio \n\n✅  Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ➞   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ize0RLIbGdH5x4wI45G-A\n\n▶️ Watch my favorite videos ➞ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhiP3P44ul3Y8LDbhXJmhVsVWcpe-7O4O\n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

This place is AWESOME!\n\nMore than 100,000 people call this unique city home, living in high-rise buildings along a narrow strip of land between steep mountains and the polluted brown River. It’s truly mind-blowing to see how Yanjin has adapted to its natural environment, with its residents making the most of every inch of space available. The towering mountains in every direction make it feel as though the city is trapped in a stunning, yet challenging, landscape. In all of my travels, I've never seen anything like this!\n\nAlso - this is my first time visiting rural China, and I have to admit, it’s been a refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of massive cities like Beijing or Shanghai. The slower pace, tight-knit community, and the way life carries on here, despite the obvious limitations, have been truly eye-opening. \n\nMainland China is full of surprises, and Yanjin is just one of the many hidden gems that I've discovered on this 18 day trip. Stay tuned for the next five videos in my China series, where I’ll be uncovering even more fascinating and lesser-known places across this incredible country!

        "description": "In Chiapas, Mexico -- people drink on average 2.2 liters of Coca-Cola PER DAY.   That is more than any country in the WORLD per capita. \n\nIn a state where there are massive shortages of both running/drinking water, Coca-Cola is found in abundance and it's THE beverage of choice.   I'm telling you that it's seen everywhere, from popular restaurants to rural villages and small shops.  It's unavoidable. \n\nBut the most surprising thing to me was when I learned that Coca-Cola is viewed as spiritual to the Tzotzil indigenous people in Chiapas.  In a town called San Juan Chamula, Coca-Cola is deeply intertwined with its culture. It's used as an offering in their main place of worship.   They believe that Coke can heal the sick, proving to be one of the most interesting rituals I've ever seen. \n\nAs a result of all of this binge coke drinking, it's no surprise that diabetes is becoming a huge problem and it's responsible for 3,000 deaths per year. \n\nI love Mexico so much, but this is an issue that I couldn't let slide.

        "description": "Are you ready to get your mind blown? \n\nLet me introduce you to a legal, yet highly addictive, drug called BETEL NUT. I've seen it being widely consumed all around the Southern parts of Asia and the Pacific islands (where it naturally grows)... but here in Papua New Guinea, they take betel nut to another level. And they chew it differently than anyone else (with a mustard seed + lime + dried seashells).\n\nMore than half the population of PNG chew betel nut daily, or \"buai\" as they call it in the local language.\" Over the last 3 days as I've been around the country, I've seen everyone from little kids (under 10) to grandparents in their 90s spitting this red stuff out of their mouths.   Betel nut is an unstoppable epidemic.\n\nThis video will educate you a little bit about betel nut -- what it is, how it's used, what it does to your health, how the epidemic is affecting the local economy, and if you watch until the end, you'll see my reactions as I try it for the first time.\n\nHave you ever tried betel nut before? Or seen people chewing it? What are your thoughts on the drug?\n\nFollow me on Instagram for more stories from every country in the world! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#papua #asia #travel\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

These incredible people survive entirely off the land, and I joined them on an actual baboon hunt (yes... BABOON!) armed only with handmade bows and arrows. From tracking animals at sunrise to eating what we caught over a fire in the bush, their raw, rugged way of life actually blew my mind. I've made over 20 stories on indigenous tribes around the world, but this one provides the most unique glimpse into a lifestyle that hasn’t been changed in thousands (!!!) of years!\n\nAlso — we had to cut out MANY scenes, and blur a lot of graphics moments to abide by YouTube's strict guidelines.

They are widely considered to be America’s most religious and closed-off community, even more than the Amish of Pennsylvania. In this 47-minute documentary, I embark on a journey to uncover the secrets of the Hasidics behind closed doors, and discover what makes their lifestyles so incredibly unique.\n\nGuided in the beginning by my friend Abby Stein, a former Hasidic rabbi who is now a transgender author, I gain a fascinating insight into Hasidic life and customs from her perspective - both the good and the bad. \n\nIn our climax scene, I meet with @ShloimeZionce, a fellow traveler and YouTuber, who opens the doors to his home so I could document a traditional Shabbat dinner with his family. With the permission of a rabbi, we capture the essence of this essential weekly ritual and the warmth and hospitality of the Hasidic people. You can follow Shloime's adventures on his channel: https://www.youtube.com/ShloimeZionce \n\nThis story is really fascinating and I'm really proud of how it came out. From the traditional clothing, music, and food to the strict gender roles and controversies surrounding the community, this documentary dives deep into every aspect of Hasidic life with a balanced portrayal of the good and the bad.\n\nJoin me on this captivating journey to experience the Hasidic Jews of Brooklyn, New York, like never seen before.\n\nFollow @drewbinsky  for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n👕 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO 🌎: https://shopjustgo.com/\n\n👫 JOIN over 33,000 people in our JUST GO APP!  https://bit.ly/3iAZlnw\n✈️ BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n► IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY Country in the world (197/197).

        "description": "Climate change never felt more real to my eyes until I arrived here in KIRIBATI - a small island nation in the Central Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe rising sea levels are quickly shrinking this country, which has a peak altitude of 3 meters.  It's projected to be entirely underwater by the year 2100. \n \nWhile many countries are feeling the impacts of climate change, nobody is more threatened right now than the 100,000+ residents of Kiribati.\n\nThe question now becomes, how do we prevent the people here from becoming climate refugees?  The only 4 options I can think of are the following:\n\n1. Build a higher sea wall (which will cost billions of USD)\n2. Buy land overseas for them to relocate (will also cost a fortune)\n3. Send more Kiribati citizens abroad (i.e. Australia and New Zealand) for jobs, and they can slowly adapt to a new life \n4. Boost tourism in Kiribati so people can see firsthand the effects of climate change, which will also pump money back into the economy\n\nWould love to get your thoughts on what we can do to help the wonderful people of Kiribati.  I encourage you all to get creative and share your best solutions below.  I will be reading and responding to as many comments as I can, and I encourage you to do the same.

They are an offshoot of the Amish (a sub-sect of Christianity that originates in Switzerland in the 1800s).  Today, the Mennonites live in small communities around the Midwest, USA, as well as in Belize, Bolivia and other countries in Latin America. What's fascianting is that they live a completely isolated life without the use of internet, TV or music -- something that is almost impossible to comprehend in today's society. \n\nThanks to my friends Zach and Janki, I was able to get secret access into a Mennonite community in northern Wisconsin, where I was able to learn about their bizarre way of life.  I was even invited into one of their homes for a meal, and it was an out-of-body experience, to say the least! \n\nWhat do you think about the Mennonites? Do you agree or disagree with their way of life?

I am well aware that all tours to North Korea are organized and preplanned, and what I saw was a skewed perspective (a small fraction) of the realities that may exist behind closed doors.   \n\nMy goal in making this video (and all videos) has always been the same – to focus on spreading happiness & positivity in our world by connecting with people across the globe.  While it’s a bit more challenging to do this in North Korea, I tried my best to show you a different side of North Korea and connect with the people – apart from all the negativity the media has brought about to this nation. \n\nMany of you know my deep love, appreciation, and connection with Korea, as I lived and taught English in Seoul for 2 years.  I can speak Korean conversationally, so I used my ability to meet eye-to-eye with as many North Koreans as I could to have conversations with them.   Most people I came across were friendly and kind-hearted, even after telling them I was American.  I was really humbled to experience this. \n\nI welcome your thoughts, feedback, and questions about my trip to North Korea.  If you enjoy this video, please share it to help spread the message of peace and positivity within North Korea.\n\n#northkorea #asia #travel  \n\nMusic: Ben Sound & Audio Autix\n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

        "description": "In Chennai, India, there is a man named Joseph, who feeds 6,000 birds every single day on his rooftop.\n\nAnd the story of how he got to feeding them is quite emotional. \n\nIn 2004, the state of Tamil Nadu was crushed by a massive tsunami that killed 230,000 people in total.   In the aftermath of this natural disaster, a few parakeets showed up on Joseph's rooftop.  He would feed them white rice, and they would keep coming back every day.  Word spread among the bird community, and now thousands show up every morning & evening to get fed.  \n\nJoseph pays $35 USD out of pocket every day to buy 75 kilograms of rice, which he carefully lays out in small piles for the birds to eat.  He hasn't missed a day in 15 years. Now that's what I call dedication!\n\nThis man truly has a heart of gold.  I can only imagine how many more parakeets will be there the next time I stop by :)\n\nJoin my travels on https://instagram.com/drewbinsky!  \n\n#india #travel #birds\n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

        "description": "Donate to Ten Yad to help those in need: https://tenyad.org.br/doe/\n\nIn São Paulo, Brazil - there is a place called Cracolandia which is known as one of the world’s most infamous open-air drug markets, where thousands of people gather daily to consume and trade illegal substances. This area is notorious for its harsh living conditions and the social challenges it presents. Despite multiple government efforts to clear the area, Cracolândia continues to linger due to its deep-rooted issues like poverty, addiction, and the lack of long-term rehabilitation solutions. The scale of this crisis has made it a symbol of the complex relationship between drug abuse, homelessness, and public health in Brazil.\n\nWalking through Cracolândia feels like stepping into a different world — like I'm living among the Walking Dead.  All I experienced was a chaotic zone, about the size of a football field, filled with addicts, dealers, and makeshift shelters. For visitors and locals alike, Cracolândia is both a shocking reality and a wild reminder of the social inequalities that continue to plague major urban centers. And despite its reputation, it also serves as a critical case study for understanding the larger global issue of urban drug epidemics.\n\nI'd love to get your thoughts on Cracolândia in the comments down below.

Did you know that over 20 million people are living in Lagos?!   It is hands down one of the most hectic, chaotic, and vibrant places I've ever been with a LOT of stories to tell. I'm overwhelmed.\n\nMy local friend and YouTuber named Tayo (his channel linked below) has been taking me all around his bustling city of Lagos and we've had an absolute blast together.  Surprisingly, this was one of the hardest videos I've ever made because it's REALLY challenging to shoot content on these streets.  People don't like being on camera here and they make a huge commotion in the streets and ask for money (etc) whenever they see it from a distance.\n\nIn any regard, I hope you enjoy this episode of my $10 series and get a glimpse into local Nigerian culture.

Many have 3 or 4 wives, but the ruler of the community who is a God-like figure named Warren Jeffs, had 85 wives until he was thrown in prison on a life sentence for sexual assault on minors (among other charges). \n\nThrough Sam, I was able to get special access to this community and the things that I experienced will leave you speechless.  I was even able to interview Warren Jeff's 65th wife -- who shares things that she never before shared on camera. \n\nI'd love to hear from you in the comments down below.

If you hate it, pay $0. \n\nThis is the story of a young man named Taiki, who spends 6 hours every day making 4 burgers for a very exclusive list of people to eat. Yes, he spends more than 1 hour to hand-craft each burger from scratch - every little detail to perfection!\n\nTaiki was introduced to burgers when he was living in Washington State a few summers ago. When he returned to Bangkok, he realized there weren't any good burger joints in town -- so he built up the courage to do it all himself.\n\nThis is one of my favorite videos I've ever made. I have a pretty good feeling that his future restaurant of Homeburg will be famous someday very soon. This video is only the start!!\n\nSide note to this video, I met Taiki because his kitchen just happens to be in the same building of my co-working space where I eat lunch every day. I always see him working his a** off every day cooking burgers, so I approached him only to discover his inspiring story.

They were so kind, warm, and hospitable, and I felt the love in their Kurdish home every second we were together.\n\nDespite being less than 2 feet tall, Afshin’s spirit is HUGE.

        "description": "Skid Row in Los Angeles is a place that I always heard about since I was a kid. Its reputation as a homeless campground, where people suffer from complex social and mental health issues, is always glossed over when people think about Hollywood.  But for the first time ever, I am going there to take you on an uncensored journey through one of the most notorious and dangerous hoods in the United States of America.  \n\nWe’ll explore the environment of Skid Row, meet the residents, and dive into the challenges they face daily -- from lack of housing and healthcare to drug addictions. \n\nThis video is not just about showing the harsh side of life, but also about sparking conversations on what can be done to bring change.\n\nMy main goal in going to Skid Row is to shed light on the human stories behind the headlines and statistics because, at the end of the day, people are just people.\n\nWhether you're familiar with Skid Row or hearing about it for the first time, I hope this video helps you understand the gravity of the situation and the humanity within it.\n\nHuge thank you to Heidi, Dante, and the whole team at Midnight Mission for guiding me around Skid Row to tell this story. Since 1914, they've been doing amazing work to help those in need on the streets of LA.

We were all laughing for the 3 hours we spent together.  \n\nThis was a very special video to make because Sultan invited us into his house, in a tiny village, where his parents (surprisingly) cooked us breakfast after the interview.   It was an amazing experience, and quite an emotional morning after hearing about some of the struggles that Sultan has been through in his life (i.e. needing to get multiple surgeries to stop his growth)...

        "description": "Syria has entered a new chapter, and entering the country in 2025 was one of the most eye-opening experiences of my life.\n\nShortly after my last visit to Syria in 2019, I was banned after releasing a video series -- even though the stories highlighted the resilience, warmth, and beauty of the Syrian people. The Assad regime didn’t approve, and I wasn’t sure if I’d ever return.\n\nBut this trip was different.  From the moment I crossed the land border, I could feel the shift — there was this energy in the air that I've never once felt.  A mix of hope, fear, and uncertainty about what comes next.\n\nFrom the ancient streets of Damascus to the remote villages of Palmyra --- I set out to understand what life looks like under Syria’s new regime. This documentary is an extremely rare and unfiltered look inside a country that has long been shrouded in conflict and mystery. I spent time with dozens of people, listened to their stories, and witnessed the changes unfolding.\n\nOn a personal note, I’ve been making videos for more than 8 years, and this story sits at the very top of my all-time favorites. My team and I poured four weeks of nonstop effort into crafting this story, and we can’t wait to hear your thoughts, reactions and questions. \n\nLet’s have an open and honest conversation in the comments. I will be reading and responding to as many comments as I can. \n\nShoutout to Young Pioneer Tours for helping arrange this trip!

Get Your Copy! https://tinyurl.com/4s78x5wy\n\nWhile I was in Tokyo a few months ago, I met a 21-year-old girl named Karin who currently lives inside an internet cafe in Tokyo.  Her room is 3 feet (1 meter) wide by 6 feet (2 meters) long, and she doesn't even have enough space to sleep horizontally.  Believe it or not, more than 5,400 others in Tokyo are living in internet cafes because it's a much cheaper alternative than paying rent for an apartment in this expensive city. \n \nKarin's situation is a sad one -- she was kicked out of her house a year ago, and physically abused by her father before becoming homeless on the streets. With little money in her bank account, she found a safe place to live at this internet cafe, and now she makes $1,300 a month by working at a hostess bar.  \n\nBut she's still struggling to get by.\n\nThis story highlights the extreme pressure of Japanese society, as well as the social isolation that comes along with it.  I'd love to hear your thoughts about Karin's situation, and the overall oddities of Japanese culture in the comments down below. \n\n#japan #tokyo #girl \n\n✅  Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ➞   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ize0RLIbGdH5x4wI45G-A\n\n▶️ Watch my favorite videos ➞ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhiP3P44ul3Y8LDbhXJmhVsVWcpe-7O4O\n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

        "description": "Japan has one of the lowest homelessness rates in the world, with less than 0.003% of its population living on the streets. This is a testament to the country's robust social programs and unique cultural approach to addressing homelessness.\n\nBut there is one slum, called Sanya, where you can find almost all of Tokyo's homeless - and my mission in this video was to go there to learn about why this place still exists, who lives on these streets, and what the future holds for such a contrasting place. \n\nJapan is truly one of my favorite countries on earth, and after 11 trips to this island nation, I have to admit that I've never seen streets like what I just saw in Sanya.  It's a gritty neighborhood historically known as a hangout for day laborers and marginalized communities.  Nowadays, you can find hundreds of homeless men wandering around a dilapidated park, playing board games, and sleeping in makeshift tents.  The surrounding alleyways are dotted with ultra-budget hostels for $10/night (the cheapest rooms in the city, but not a place I'd recommend to sleep).  \n\nThe overall experience of walking around Sanya is just bizarre, and I think it's important that we don't turn a blind eye on the homeless -- even in a country like Japan. \n\nI originally intended to only make this story about Sanya, but after learning about yakuza (gangster) culture, I went on a separate mission to meet a real yakuza member in Fukuoka. I couldn't believe the things he told me which you will find out in the second half of this video!\n\nI'd love to get your thoughts on this darker side of Japan - did you know that homelessness and gangster life existed here? Or is all of this news for you? Comment below! \n\nHuge thank you to @JiDion for connecting me to Mr. Yuyama, to @Poudii for letting me use some of your yakuza footage. And to @OrientalPearl for being the first to introduce what Sanya is on her channel - two shots in my video were used from her Japan stories. All of these creators mentioned make really awesome videos, so check them out! \n\nShoutout to Kosuke for taking me around Japan, you can find his Instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/kousukeofficial0.  And finally, to Mr. Yuyama himself, who runs this YouTube channel @youyama which gives insight into life as an ex-yakuza!\n\n#japan #travel #culture \n\n✅  Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ➞   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ize0RLIbGdH5x4wI45G-A\n\n▶️ Watch my favorite videos ➞ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhiP3P44ul3Y8LDbhXJmhVsVWcpe-7O4O\n\nThank you to ElevenLabs for dubbing my videos into Spanish, French and Portuguese!

I've been very interested in the Rastafarian culture since I got hooked on Bob Marley as a teenager. I mean, wasn't everyone obsessed with Bob Marley at some point in their lives?  He is a living legend! \n\nIt turns out that Bob Marley was one of the first people to bring his Rasta culture to all corners of the world.  And believe it or not, Rastafari is not just a culture or a social movement -- it's the world's newest religion that started in the 1930s (as an offshoot of Christianity).  Rasta people typically have dreadlocks, listen to reggae music, eat vegan food and smoke a lot of ganja. \n\nI went to Jamaica to learn more about the Rastafarian people, culture, and lifestyle -- and I ended up spending 48 hours with an amazing community in the Blue Mountains.

This island is full of life, culture, beaches, and reggae music, and it makes for an excellent vacation destination...

In recent years, the nation has emerged as one of the most dangerous in the Caribbean with gang violence and political turmoil in the slums areas.

With a population of 36 million (yes, you read that right – 36 million!), Chongqing is a municipality that feels more like its own country. This city is massive and chaotic with futuristic skyscrapers and bustling street markets. It’s one of the most affordable big cities in the world and there’s something here for everyone to explore.\n\nIn this old-school travel vlog, I’ll take you on an adventure through the heart of Chongqing to meet the locals, try some of the spiciest food (hot pot, anyone?), and uncover the wacky culture that makes Chongqing such a unique destination.\n\nWhat really stood out to me about Chongqing is how it has all the energy and conveniences of a place like Hong Kong, but with almost ZERO tourists. The culture shock here is real, the people are incredibly kind, and the vibe is unlike any other city I’ve experienced in my travels to all 197 countries.\n\nI hope you enjoy the video, and please comment below with your thoughts! :)\n\n#china #asia #travel \n\n✅  Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ➞   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ize0RLIbGdH5x4wI45G-A\n\n▶️ Watch my favorite videos ➞ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhiP3P44ul3Y8LDbhXJmhVsVWcpe-7O4O\n\nThank you to ElevenLabs for dubbing my videos into Spanish, French, Portuguese, German and Arabic!

Forced into marriage at 12 years old, she had her first set of quintuplets at 13, and then gave birth on 16 more occasions (to quintuplets, triplets, and twins) -- before her 40th birthday.  Even crazier, she raises ALL of them as a single mother (her ex-husband abused and abandoned her.)\n\nBut Mama Uganda is a warrior, a superhuman and a true African legend who is one of the most inspiring people I've ever met. \n\nIf you're reading this - I'd love to hear from you in the comments down below - what do you think of Mama Uganda?

And it turned out to be one of the most incredible experiences that I've had within my own country, the United States of America.  \n\nMy friend @JessicaKobeissi took me around her stomping grounds to introduce me to the culture that she grew up in, and I was completely amazed. So many Lebanese, Iraqis, Yemenis, Bangladeshis, Somalis, Syrians (etc) all living together in this suburban Michigan town called Hamtramck, along with nearby Dearborn.  \n\nI went during the very first day of Ramadan - the holiest month in Islam - and I even participated in the fast myself. Watch until the end to see what is breaking the fast (or iftar) at Jessica's friend's house.\n\nThe moral of this story is that America is SO BIG and SO DIVERSE, and there are many micro-communities to be discovered. Would you like to see more stories about the different communities in the USA? Please comment below and let me know - your feedback is so valuable to me.

Then, she illegally entered Thailand without a passport, where she was thrown in jail for 1 month.  After getting in touch with the South Korean embassy, they granted her citizenship and allowed her to move to Seoul.\n\nWhile it was difficult for her to adjust to South Korean culture at first, she now lives a great life as an actress on TV and making videos for her YouTube and Instagram accounts (@kang_naraa)\n\nThis has been a special story for me to create because I spent 4 days in North Korea in 2017 and I got a glance at what society she grew up in...  We chatted about everything from her thoughts on Kim Jong-un to the struggles that she faces adjusting to life in South Korea today.\n\nIf you find Nara's story inspiring - please share this video with your friends!\n\nJoin me on Instagram @drewbinsky for more: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\n#northkorea #travel #asia \n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

Many of you probably haven’t heard of Eritrea before and that’s because it’s a relatively new country and it’s notoriously difficult to enter (top 5 in the world).  After 48 hours of roaming around the capital of Asmara and the ancient port city of Massawa, I’ve really enjoyed my time here. \n\nI’m getting flashbacks to when I was in Ethiopia, yet also touches of Yemen Somaliland and Italy. Yes - ITALY! Eritrea is a former Italian colony and their influence is remarkably well-preserved in the form of giant cathedrals, pizza parlors, gelato shops, old Italian cars, appertivos and many people can still speak fluent Italiano. \n\nThe capital of Asmara is VERY safe, with kind-hearted people and surprisingly the weather is cold here (2,400 meters high). Unfortunately due to WiFi issues, I haven't been able to upload anything until now, but there’s no hurry because life is wonderful here!

        "description": "As a traveler, and someone who has been to every single country in the world, nothing excites me more than YEMEN.  Out of all the dangerous countries that I've visited -- including Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia, Syria, etc --  no place is more dangerous for tourists to visit than mainland Yemen. \n\nI went on an 8-day road trip to Yemen, all by myself, and it was one of the wildest trips of my life.  I ended up meeting a local tour guide, Abdul, but he was very unpredictable and left me feeling uncomfortable the whole trip.  That being said, I had a very memorable time and this video highlights everything from Yemen!\n\nIt's important to know that Yemen is a very complex country (both politically, culturally and economically), and should only be visited if you are an experienced traveler.  It's very risky to visit Yemen and I do not advise going there alone.  \n\n#yemen #middleeast #travel \n\nFollow @drewbinsky  for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n👕 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO 🌎: https://shopjustgo.com/\n\n👫 JOIN over 33,000 people in our JUST GO APP!  https://bit.ly/3iAZlnw\n✈️ BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n► IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY Country in the world (197/197).

After speaking with them for about 30 minutes, I was in awe of their inspiring life story.  \n\nVijayan and his wife both shared a common dream to travel the world, but money was always an issue.  So 55 years ago, Vijayan took up selling tea on the streets of Kochi.\n\nThey saved 300 Rupees ($4.20) every day for decades, and they used this income (together with bank loans) to fund travels to 23 countries!   From Switzerland to Brazil to the USA, and they don't plan on stopping anytime soon.\n\nVijayan and Mohana are a perfect couple who is living the happiest life that anyone can live.

We started in Kochi, then went to Kollam, Madurai, Pondicherry, Auroville and Chennai, hitting many small villages and towns in between.\n\nAfter this trip, I've now spent almost 4 months combined on the Indian subcontinent -- and I've reconfirmed my love for this country.  Through all the ups and downs, this is really a special and unique place that I recommend everyone to visit at least once in their life.\n\nSpeaking of unique, I have noticed many cultural things while traveling India that are not commonly seen elsewhere around the world...  So I decided to make this fun video, sharing all of my realizations about Indian culture! \n\nDo you agree or disagree with any of my points?

It's normal for people to live well past 100 years old!\n\nIn this video, I'll be sharing my personal experience of exploring the island and discovering the reasons behind the exceptional health and longevity of the people living here. From traditional cultural practices to local diets and lifestyle habits, you'll learn about the unique factors that contribute to the extraordinary health of the Okinawan people. And not only that but you'll also be amazed by the tropical and laid-back atmosphere of the island, which sets it apart from mainland Japan.\n\nIn this story, you'll get to see the beautiful beaches, lush forests, and vibrant culture of Okinawa and learn how these elements contribute to the overall well-being of its people.

And inside of Tondo, you will find a lovely lady named Evelyn who serves freshly made \"pag pag\" from the confines of her own home.  Pag pag is the Tagalog slang for 'leftover food' from restaurants such as McDonald's and Jollibee, where the scraps have been taken from garbage sites around town and brought to Tondo to be recooked into unique dishes, and sold on the streets.  Evelyn has been dumpster diving and cooking pag pag for over 1 year, and I was really curious to learn more about it, so I went deep into the slum to meet her and tell you her full story.  As sad as it may seem from the outside, you will soon learn that this is a success story -- Evelyn makes more money than her friends working corporate jobs, and she has sent all of her kids to college from her pag pag earnings\n\nMost of you guys already know that the Philippines is my absolute favorite country in the world.

I made this story because I feel that poverty in the Philippines shouldn't go unnoticed, as nearly 4 million people in Manila are living in them.  Evelyn is as sweet as can be, and I think many of you will find her story to be uplifting and motivational.

The first is RIALS (the official Iranian currency), and the second is TUMAN (which is like the Rial, without the last zero). As a traveler, you don’t know which price is listed unless you ask. $1 USD = 50,000 Rials and that same $1 dollar = 5,000 Tuman. Sound confusing? ... It is! \n\nMoreover, the only way to get money in Iran as a tourist is by bringing lots of cash (USD or Euros is preferred) and then exchanging it for Iranian Rials when you arrive. The reason is that there are no ATMs in Iran that cater to foreign banks. \n\nIf you are as confused reading this as I am typing it out, then this video will explain the confusing world of the Iranian Rial a little better. \n\nJust curious, did you know anything about this before I made this video?

        "description": "The Philippines is my favorite country in the world and I have been here more than 75 times.  There is truly nothing like the Filipino spirit, their unparalleled warmth, and genuine hospitality.  However, beneath this beautiful exterior lies a reality that cannot be ignored: the severe poverty in Manila. With over 40% of the city's 23 million residents living in slums, the conditions they endure are among the most challenging in the world.\n\nIn this episode, I venture deep into the heart of Manila's largest and most impoverished slum called Tondo. Here, I discover a community living along a heavily polluted bay and directly beneath the constant bustle of a busy highway.  \n\nDespite the heart-wrenching circumstances, the individuals we encountered are nothing short of incredible. Their stories and resilience are both inspiring and humbling. Through this journey, I hope to shed light on the incredible strength of the Filipino people and offer a glimpse into their daily lives. Join me as we uncover the true spirit that makes Filipinos the most resilient people in the world\n\nMore to come soon from the Philippines - I would love to hear from you in the comments down below on this story. \n\n#philippines #travel #life \n\n✅  Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ➞   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ize0RLIbGdH5x4wI45G-A\n\n▶️ Watch my favorite videos ➞ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhiP3P44ul3Y8LDbhXJmhVsVWcpe-7O4O\n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

Discover the untold stories and untapped beauty that lie beyond the headlines, showcasing the true spirit of the Iranian people and their warm hospitality - which might just be the absolute best in the world. \n\nI am not blind to the fact that Iran has been going through a revolution since Aug 2021, when a young lady was killed for not wearing her hijab in public - so I wanted to give my platform to various Iranian women to open up and share their own personal stories about the situation.

I do NOT support this war, and my thoughts go out to our friends in Ukraine. We love you. \n\nWelcome to YAKUTSK, (SIBERIA) - AKA the WORLD'S COLDEST CITY.  More than 300,000 people live here, where winter temperatures (like right now) reach as low as -55 Celsius. \n\nI went to Yakutsk a few weeks ago with my good friend Ammar from @YesTheory.  The city is so remote that we had to take a 9-hour domestic flight from Moscow to get there. \n\nAs soon as we arrived in this cold winter wonderland, I couldn’t believe my eyes.  Completely frozen trees, frozen pipelines, frozen cars… frozen everything!!  But underneath the layers of jackets are extremely friendly faces and warm smiles.  And that’s what I came here to learn about - humanity.  Who are the Yakutian people? How do they survive these brutally cold winters? \n\nThis video takes you on a 4-day journey through the world’s coldest city - Yakutsk.  I think you will be quite surprised to discover that Yakutsk is actually a normal city, just like anywhere else. It just happens to be extremely cold! \n\nThank you to my local friends Maria #1 and Maria #2 (from @MariaSolko) for showing me around! And thanks to Andrey for the awesome work behind the camera.

But this time around, I went in with fresh eyes and a new perspective, and I really enjoyed it!!! \n\nI met up with a local Bruneian friend from Instagram named Bryant, and he took me under his wing to show me his version of Brunei.

        "description": "The past few days in N'Djamena, Chad have been the worst days of my entire life and I've had a miserable time here. Never in my life have I been more scared, threatened, or attacked (both verbally and physically) than in this hot, dusty, beaten-down deserted city. I was in a disastrous police chase on a motorbike and I also was attacked by a dozen people for taking 1 photo inside a minibus. I apologize for the lack of posting lately - I've had no access to wifi until now and I'm still shaken up by what has happened to me.\n\nIf it wasn't for my 6'6'' local friend (AKA Bodyguard), then I'm not sure I'd be alive right now. This is not a joke, this is serious.\n\nThe lesson learned has been learned on my end to always ask before taking a photo of anyone, but it was uncalled for these people to attack me as they did. I will end this post by saying that I do not hate Chad (as a whole) and I realize that unlucky situations can make or break your experience in any country. But it's safe to say that I will not be coming back to Chad anytime soon.\n\nWhat's the worst thing that's happened to you on the road?

I came here with one goal: to meet the NOSE PLUG TRIBE and tell you their fascinating story.  \n\nBack in the day, the humble ladies of the Apatani tribe would plug their noses with thick pieces of bamboo to avoid getting kidnapped (by men from neighboring tribes).  Then in 1975, the Indian government banned nose plugging, and today, there are less than 500 women remaining. You will get to know several of them in this 20-minute documentary. \n\nI learned a lot about Northeast India while shooting this story, and I hope that you feel inspired by this incredible region. There is still plenty more of India to explore, as you will see in my next 2 videos!\n\nDoes anyone read these descriptions anymore?

He travels with an Iraqi passport - which is the least powerful in the world, ranking 193 out of 193 in the World's Global Passport Index.\n\nWhen I posted on social media that I was coming to Iraqi Kurdistan, Baderkhan immediately reached out and offered to host me for 4 days.   We've had an incredible time together road-tripping around his homeland -- which I find to be the hidden gem of the Middle East.\n\nThis is the story of Baderkhan's life -- as he travels the world on the weakest passport.   It makes me feel guilty that I can visit 165 countries without the need to get a visa (compared to only 30 for him), but that only gives him more motivation to keep going and see every country in the world.\n\nThank you, Baderkhan, for being a role model and inspiration for your peers to follow their dreams.

All 5 destinations were long layovers of about 24 hours, and I truly had a blast filming each video — it's a marathon every time!\n\nHere is a compilation of all 5 videos in chronological order, where you can see how many things I bought for just $500 USD.  I think you'll notice a HUGE difference in video quality (i.e editing) from the first episode in Hong Kong, to the most recent one in Bali :)\n\nTo sum it up in words, I got the following items for $500: \n\n- HONG KONG: 5 metro rides, 2 trams, 1 ferry, 1 bus, 1 cable car, 1 BBQ pork, 1 order garlic clams,  3 beers, 1 dim sum breakfast\n- BARCELONA: 1 airport train ticket, 10 metro rides, 1 Air Bnb room, 1 tapas & beer, ticket to La Sagrada, 1 cup of sangria, 1 plate giant paella\n- ISTANBUL: 1 bus ride, 1 hotel night, 2 kebabs, 4 baklava, 2 Turkish coffee, 1 metro ride, 1 shisha & tea, Efes beer, 1 kumpir (stuffed baked potato), 1 gold tea set, 1 box Turkish delights, 1 haircut, 1 Uber ride\n- DUBAI: 1 bus ride, 1 hotel room, 2 shawarmas & smoothie, unlimited metro rides, UAE flag, 3 magnets, shisha & tea, 1 boat ride, 1 Uber ride\n- BALI: 2 taxi rides, 3 beers, 1 nasi goreng (fried rice), 1 hotel room, 1 mee goreng (fried noodles), 1 banana shake, 1 coconut, 1 cat poop coffee, 1 motorbike rental, 1 petrol fill up, 1 temple tickets, 1 monkey forest ticket, 1 butter crab, 1 massage\n\nPHEW - that is a lot of stuff!!

It's my first time in this chaotic city, and man, what an adventure it has been -- completely opposite from the Amazon rainforest, where I flew in from!  As soon as I arrived in São Paulo, I went straight to the most notorious & dangerous slum (favela) called Paraisópolis.  It's a place where the police are too scared to visit because they will be shot at.  It's a community where drug dealers and gangsters literally run the society. \n\nI've visited a lot of the world's most dangerous slums/hoods from India to Kenya to Venezuela - but Paraisópolis is different.  \n\nThis video is one of the most raw and honest stories I've ever made, and it will give you a rare glimpse into Brazil's street life.

We are trying to look past the negatives and stay positive, but it's impossible when situations like this are happening to us every day at every single border crossing and police checkpoint.\n\nThe level of corruption and bribery is out of this world, and we've experienced the worst here today on the border of Liberia entering Sierra Leone.  We were scammed because we didn't have a cholera shot (which is 100% NOT the requirement, only yellow fever is).  We were asked to pay $350, which we eventually settled at $150 (for 3 of us), and the worst part is that this money went directly into these corrupt officials' pockets.  \n\nThese guys, in full uniforms, are bandits.  Thieves.  And it makes me depressed thinking about it.  I feel defeated.   But we are moving on.\n\nThanks for watching.

Wait until you see this story, it will blow your mind!!\n\nI had to take a 2-hour boat ride from Longyearbyen (the biggest town in Svalbard) which is under Norwegian control, over to Barentsburg (the second-biggest town in Svalbard) which is under Russian control.\n\nThe two towns could not be any more different. \n\nAfter visiting 169 countries and more than 500 cities, I find Barentsburg to be the absolute most bizarre town in the world.   \n\nIt was purchased by the Soviet Union about 90 years ago from the Dutch because of the on-site coal mine... While there are about 400 Russian & Ukrainian miners still working here today, it's a failing business, and it's obvious that Russia keeps this place alive because they want a presence in the Arctic (think natural resources, trade routes, etc).  \n\nWalking around Barentsburg gave me flash backs to North Korea.  Abandoned buildings.  Seemingly staged people and culture.   I still can't quite wrap my head around this!\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please share it!

He has a fascinating life story of traveling and living abroad since he was 7, and how he converted to Islam 15 years ago.   Yousaf, who is a devout practicing Muslim, spends his days selling rice pudding on the streets of Dahab and is somewhat of a local celebrity in town.  I will never forget my time spent with Yousaf -- he is full of knowledge and it's enlightening to be in his presence. \n\nJust out of curiosity, have you ever converted to a different religion?

        "description": "Ladyboys, or transgenders, are extremely common in Thailand and you will see them everywhere — on the streets, on the metro, in restaurants, and especially in nightlife areas. Many times, you won't even notice it's a ladyboy, since they look like beautiful women.\n\nThe reason I made this video is to A) educate you about the ladyboy culture in Thailand and B) tell you how accepting Thailand is to treat them like normal members of society. It's remarkable.\n\nAs you and I both know, dozens and dozens of countries in today's world are moving in the opposite direction toward acceptance of those in the LGBTQ community — so this video can be a lesson to the world. \n\nThey are just people — let them live their lives. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on ladyboys? Would love to get your opinions. Thank you\n\n#transgender #lgbt #thailand \n\nP.S...

With a jaw-dropping $170 million invested to recreate that classic cowboy vibe in Wyoming, I knew that I had to see this for myself. Is it really as “American” as they claim? Are people actually living there, or is it a ghost town?  \n\nTo help me get to the bottom of it, I teamed up with my friend Rachel, a fellow American who’s been living in China for 8 years and speaks conversational Mandarin. Together, we’re diving into this strange town to uncover the truth – from cowboy hats to horse riding to sizzling steaks, we’re exploring just how wild (and weird) this “Western” town really is.\n\nFollow Rachel on Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/rachelmeetschina\n\n#china #travel #america\n\n✅  Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ➞   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ize0RLIbGdH5x4wI45G-A\n\n▶️ Watch my favorite videos ➞ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhiP3P44ul3Y8LDbhXJmhVsVWcpe-7O4O\n\nThank you to ElevenLabs for dubbing my videos into Spanish, French and Portuguese!

It has essentially been the most dangerous city in the world for the last 3 decades, due to the ongoing Civil War which began started in 1991.  Tourism is almost nonexistent, and if you do come, then you must take precautions and follow the rules given to you at all times. \n\nBUT once I have looked past all the military checkpoints and I've gotten over my initial anxiety of being here, I am seeing an amazing culture with some of the kindest people I've ever met.

The last time I met the pygmies, I was alone in the Central African Republic, and this time, I went deep into the Democratic Republic of Congo (4,000 miles away) with Deanna and our local friend, Obed. \n\nThe journey was not easy, as we battled flat tires, massive thunderstorms, and my camera nearly getting stolen from someone at a street market in Bukavu (the 3rd biggest city in the DR Congo). But the payoff in the end was pure magic - the pygmies are so welcoming and fun! They literally danced around the fire while beating the drums from the moment we met until we left (15 hours straight).  \n\nThis is one of those stories and experiences that (when it's all said and done), I will be remembered for. It is a pleasure to share this story with you, that my team and I spent 5 weeks editing, and I hope that you enjoy!

Find out what $10 USD can get you in Venezuela!  \n\nIn this epic adventure, I take you on the bustling streets of Caracas and through the beautiful beach towns of Morrocoy to see how many things I could purchase with $10 USD, which at the time I made this video, was 14.7 MILLION Venezuelan Bolivares... Right now, $10 USD is equal to 22 million Bolivares; it's absolutely crazy. \n\nDespite Venezuela's economic crisis and massive hyperinflation, the cost of everyday items is getting more expensive, which makes it even harder for the local people to afford basic things like bread and water.

The locals are called Inuits (the same ethnic group as Eskimos), and they survive from hunting and eating polar bears, walrus, seals, and whales.  \n\nCould you ever live here?

Yay!\n------------\nI recently hit the streets of Caracas with my local friends Gabo and Emmanuel to see if we could exchange $100 USD for local Venezuelan Bolivares.   At the time when I shot this video, $100 USD was about 170 Million Bolivares, but now at the time of posting, $100 USD is about 300 million Bolivares.  The currency has depreciated by almost 100%.  \n\nWe spent ALL day walking into small shops, bakeries, market vendors (etc) in Caracas and unfortunately, we were only able to exchange $62...  Yes, we really did have a backpack full of cash on our backs.  It was wild. \n\nThe economic crisis in Venezuela is very sad and it's hard to comprehend what's happening.  And how fast it's happening.  I have empathy for the people here who are suffering to make ends meet, but instead of dwelling on the situation, it's been refreshing to see many of the locals being resilient and optimistic for a brighter future.    I made this video to give you a glimpse of real life on the streets of Caracas because I think it's important to give you an honest perspective.

She went from living in a modern and peaceful country to an impoverished and dangerous one, and it's been difficult for her to adapt.  \n\nCan you imagine being trapped in Yemen after growing up in an advanced society in Riyadh? As much as she wants to leave to study, she must wait until the situation clears up and the borders/airports reopen.  \n\nThis video also explains her perspective on what must be done for Yemen to overcome this disaster and go back to how life used to be 10 years ago.  It's a fascinating interview and I enjoyed hearing her thoughts.

Today I take you around the bustling city of Cairo, Egypt to see how far I can stretch $ 10 USD (PS: I got 10 items!).\n\nI actually went to Cairo the first time in 2015 - way back when I was a budget backpacker and travel blogger (before I owned a video camera).  I was young and naïve and to be honest, I didn't have a great time here.  \n\nBut now, I'm back with fresh eyes and new perspectives, and let's just say that I'm enjoying Cairo about 10X as much as I did 5 years ago.  It's also a very special time to visit because there are (literally) ZERO TOURISTS HERE, so I had the Pyramids of Giza all to myself.   As long as you take precautions (wear a mask, avoid physical contact, wash hands frequently), then traveling is possible right now amid this new normal. \n\nHave you ever been to Cairo?

The combination of bad weather and a public holiday has left me stranded with almost nothing to do, nobody to meet and no sites to see.\n\nBut amid all of my loneliness, I managed to find one small shop open in the capital town of Victoria, where I was kindly greeted by an Indian man, named Hari Haran, who was working behind the counter.\n\nAfter speaking with him for just a few minutes and getting to know his life story (and struggles), I asked for his permission to record our talk and put it on my FB page. He agreed, and that is what you are about to watch in this video.  Can you believe that he works 365 days every year? Could you ever work 365 days in one year?\n\nListening to his story is a reminder to be thankful if you are happy with your job and are able to live closely with your loved ones.

What she experienced was horrible — being sold as a sex slave by border officials, walking across Mongolia in the middle of winter and nearly dying of starvation.  \n\nBut Yeonmi made it out alive, and now she lives happily in Chicago.  She is outspoken about the terrible regime in North Korea and she voices her thoughts on her YouTube Channel and through various best-selling books.  I invite you to share your opinions about Yeonmi’s story and about North Korea in general in the comments below. \n\nHope you had a very Merry Christmas and remember that freedom is not always free. \n\nI’ll see you in the next year when I’m kicking off my Saudi Arabia videos!!! \n\nFollow @drewbinsky  for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n► IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY Country in the world (197/197).

The city felt scary, unpredictable, and deeply wounded by decades of conflict, and to this day, I’ve considered Mogadishu the most dangerous city on Earth.\n\nSo, why did I get the urge to come back?\n\nBecause I wanted to see what has changed. Is Mogadishu healing? Are things getting better? And most importantly, what do the Somali people have to say about their own future?\n\nIn this video, I return to Somalia’s capital not just to walk its streets again, but to connect with locals, ask tough questions, and share their voices with the world.

The only reason I'd ever go to 7-Eleven is to fill up my gas tank and/or get a slurpee. \n\nBut in Thailand (and many Asian countries), 7-Eleven takes on a completely new meaning.   It’s your one-stop shop for anything and everything you can think of.  7-Eleven is pretty much the World's Best convenience store in the history of mankind. \n\nInside 7-Eleven, you can find (literally) thousands of unique food and beverage options — but even beyond that, 7-Eleven is a place where you can pay your phone & internet bills, schedule mail for pick up, purchase sporting event tickets and grab all of your toiletries and cosmetics.  \n\nThailand alone has over 11,000 7-Eleven locations (the second-most behind Japan) and it does 500 billion Baht ($15B USD) in revenue a year.    It's hard to explain how incredible this store is unless you've been to Thailand (or Asia) and experienced it for yourself.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on 7-Eleven?

I have spent the better part of the last decade trying to meet a real-life cannibal, and I finally have completed my goal here in Varanasi, India.  For real! His name is \"Baba\" and he is an Aghori man who lives on the banks of the Ganges River - the site where more than 300 bodies are cremated every day and their ashes are thrown into the river.  Varanasi is the most spiritual place in India, and for Hindus, it's the holiest place to have their bodies burned. \n\nBaba explained to me the various reasons why he eats humans (spoiler alert: he said the heart is the best part of the body) - and what I discovered will leave you speechless. \n\nThank you Shubham for taking me around Varanasi.

        "description": "On October 29, 2021, at 1:31AM - I crossed the border into Saudi Arabia, MY 197th & FINAL COUNTRY which took me 11 years to complete!!! 🇸🇦🙏 \n\nI'm feeling lots of emotions right now, and it will take some time to digest over the next few weeks as I travel across Saudi Arabia, but I just want to say first and foremost, THANK YOU ❤️\n\nThank you to my better half, Deanna, for believing in me since we met 6 years ago.  Thank you to my loving parents and family for supporting me.  Thank you to all of my best friends for pushing me during the hard times.  Thank you to all the strangers and local tour guides I met, in faraway places, for keeping me safe and secure.  And most importantly, if you’re reading this, THANK YOU. \n\nI’m so grateful for this amazing YouTube community.  I want you guys to know that for the past 4 years, I've poured my blood, sweat, and tears into telling the best stories about people and culture.  And I am so freaking happy that you guys have been able to travel with me as I visited all 197 countries in the world.  Thank you for all your comments, questions, advice, and words of encouragement. Without you, I do not stand here right now, in tears, at the Jeddah airport. \n\nIt has taken me 10 long years (almost exactly to the day) to achieve this goal, since I moved to Prague to study abroad in Jan 2012.  I was 20 years old back then. Now I am 30.  It’s crazy to think that I’ve been on the road nonstop, roughly 3,600 days, without taking a break. \n\nBut I made it!!! And I’m feeling as happy as ever.  I did it.  I FREAKING DID IT!!! I can now say that I have visited every single country in the world. \n\nThis is not the end of Drew Binsky.  It’s only the beginning!  I will now be chasing the STORY, not so much the COUNTRY.  This means a bigger team that can help take my videos to the next level!  But there are a lot of exciting projects that I'm working on -- below are links to my favorite ones:\n\n1) My 2nd YT channel is called “More Travels with Drew Binsky,” where I will be telling you more inspiring stories around the globe.  Subscribe here: https://bit.ly/3vQNSFY\n\n2) My Travel Hacking Course is live, Get the 1st Chapter FREE! https://www.drewbinsky.com/course\n\n3) I am launching both a book and a docuseries in the next 1-2 years!   More info on the film can be found here: http://drewbinskydocumentary.com/\n\nTHANK YOU, ONCE AGAIN, FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.  I LOVE YOU!!

The entire production cycle -- from digging deep in the soil to formulating the bricks, laying them out to dry, tossing them onto trucks and burning them in brick ovens. \n\nWhat I was seeing was so massive and intense that I decided to make a video about it on the spot. I went into the brick fields to interview several brickmakers in Madagascar to learn more about their strenuous lives. Special thanks to my new friends Ali, Dave, Nancy and Antonio for helping me translate -- this video (and all my others) would not have been possible without your help.\n\nI want to get your opinion on something -- the most frustrating thing I saw today was really young kids (5-8 years old) tossing bricks for 10+ hours a day in the hot sun. Do you think it's morally right to force them to work labor-intensive jobs at such a young age?

It's the reason why I travel. \n\nThe pygmies are a group of tribal ethnicities native to Central Africa (Gabon, Cameroon, DRC and Central African Republic).  About 900,000 of them in total are entirely dependent on the dense forest for survival.  Genetically speaking, they are the world's shortest ethnic group for unknown reasons.  \n\nI just spent 24 hours with them here in a remote part of Central African Republic and I made this story from my experience.  Please note that I had full permission from the chief to make this story and he was very happy that I came, as you'll hear about in the interview after the credits. \n\nIf you find this story interesting, please share it with your friends!

It’s the 2nd holiest city in Islam and I always assumed that it was off-limits to non-Muslims (similar to Mecca) — but I was wrong!  Anybody is allowed to visit Medina (even Jews!), they just can’t venture inside the gates of the Prophet’s Mosque.\n\nI went to Medina with my local friend, Abdullah, the same guy who took me on a virtual tour of Mecca. And I really enjoyed my time in the city.  There is this overwhelming spirit in the air, something similar to Jerusalem or Varanasi, and it’s something I will never forget!  \n\nHave you ever been to Medina?

        "description": "I have finally met with the LONG NECK tribe of Northern Thailand - and they are truly some of the most fascinating humans on earth! \n\nAs you probably know, my favorite thing to do when traveling is to discover and interact with the most local people I can find. To eat their food, observe their homes and experience first-hand how they survive. \n\nI’ve spent quality time with the Himba tribe of Namibia, the Mursi tribe of Ethiopia and the Huli tribe of Papua New Guinea. But never have I seen women wearing dozens of heavy metal rings around their neck... until I came to Northern Thailand!! \n\nThey wear the rings (traditionally) to protect from tiger bites, but also to differentiate from the other hi tribes of Myanmar/Thailand.. and of course, it’s also a beauty/fashion thing!\n\nThe long necks are actually refugees from Myanmar who crossed the border in the 18th century and never returned back home. There are some 40,000 of them remaining today, mostly up in the mountains near the Burma border. \n\nHave you ever heard about the long neck tribe? What do you think about their culture?

        "description": "The past few days in Antananarivo, Madagascar have been overwhelming, intense and eye-opening. And I apologize for the delays in posting these videos -- it's been nearly impossible to find decent enough wifi.\n\nMadagascar, as a whole, is a beautiful tropical island with stunning greenery, giant baobab trees and unique wildlife (like lemurs!). It's also massive -- about twice the size of my home state of Arizona -- floating 250 miles off the southeastern part of mainland Africa. \n\nBut putting the natural beauty aside, Madagascar is one of the World's poorest countries, with the 5th lowest GDP per capita. Walking on the streets of Antananarivo, I couldn't help but observe and analyze what I was seeing --- people just barely managing to survive, working labor-intensive jobs with very little pay.\n\nMy new local friends and I took a mini road trip to some outer villages, where I learned about the daily life of people working in the markets. Here's what I discovered. \n\nIf there's any takeaway from today (and through travel in general) -- it is to appreciate the life I live. If you are reading this as well, consider yourself lucky because you have internet, which most of the people in Madagascar cannot afford. \n\n#travel #africa #documentary \n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

        "description": "I've now spent over 3 weeks of my life in Afghanistan, and I have barely told you about the AMAZING food that exists in this country!   In fact, I would honestly say that Afghanistan has some of the most underrated street food in the entire world.  All of the dishes here are so delicious, so plentiful and SO CHEAP!\n\nIn today's video, I take you on the streets of Bamiyan (in the central region of the country) to try some of the best Afghan street foods - IS ANYONE HUNGRY OUT THERE?! \n\nPlease note that this video was extremely hard to edit because just 2 weeks after I left Bamiyan, there were 2 massive blasts that destroyed the main marketplace, leaving 14 people dead and dozens more wounded.  100% of this video was shot in that exact marketplace, which is now in ruins, and I am just devastated.  \n\nIn any regard, Bamiyan (and Afghanistan as a whole) is one of my favorite places on earth -- the culture is so raw and authentic, and the people are some of the most hospitable in the world!  I am loving every second of this trip and I can't wait to tell you more stories from the wonderful country of Afghanistan. \n\nPS - Would you try any of these Afghan dishes?

        "description": "Hey Guys!  So as many of you know, I went to Port-au-Prince (Haiti's capital city) a few months ago with my local friend & guide named Sean.  It was the single scariest trip of my life. 90% of the city is controlled by ruthless gangs, and going into the slums with Sean was a wild experience.  You can watch the full story of my Haiti trip here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmM7SDGOQiQ&t=1s\n\nAbout a month ago, my friend Arab @arab who makes great content about culture and street life, went to Haiti with Sean to shoot a similar story.  Unfortunately, both men were kidnapped by gangsters for 17 long days - and it spread like wildfire across international news. Thankfully, the two men made it out alive after paying a hefty bribe.  \n\nI caught up with Sean just a few days after he escaped, and here is the full story. \n\nCheck out Arab's channel for more of the story in Haiti: https://www.youtube.com/@UC8H9Zmx8CslalkliFegKXhQ \n\n#haiti #scary #travel \n\n✅  Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ➞   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ize0RLIbGdH5x4wI45G-A\n▶️ Watch my favorite videos ➞ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhiP3P44ul3Y8LDbhXJmhVsVWcpe-7O4O\n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

He currently resides safely in Turkey.  In any regard, I'm going to tell you one of the most interesting stories that I've come across in all of my travels.\n\nMeet Zablon Simintov -- the last and only remaining Afghan Jew in Afghanistan.\n\nAs a successful entrepreneur in his early years (carpet trading) -- this man has suffered a lot over the last 25 years.  He was sent to prison camps by the Taliban, he got all of his carpet stolen by the Mujahideen overnight ($300,000 USD worth), and his entire family and friends left him behind for Israel, Europe, and the U.S.\n\nBut somehow, Zablon has kept up being an Orthodox Jew, and taking care of the only working Synagogue in the country.  He practices Shabbat, keeps kosher, and speaks Hebrew. As a Jew myself, this has been an absolutely amazing story to hear and we had a connection that I cannot explain.\n\nAlso FYI,  I found out Zablon yesterday and booked a last-minute flight to Kabul to try and find him (I originally wasn't planning to come to Kabul).  I am beyond happy that I did.\n\nJoin me as I share with you Zablon's full story, which I hope you enjoy hearing because this has been a VERY special experience for me.  It's one of my favorite videos that I've had the pleasure to share and it's a day that I'll never forget.\n\n#jewish #afghanistan #religion \n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n►TW: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

I was invited here by the Taiwan Tourism Bureau to cover parts of the island that I never knew existed, which led me down to the countryside to visit a few indigenous tribes.  Did you know that the indigenous Taiwanese were the original settlers of the Philippines and many other Pacific Islands?  I was fascinated to learn about this!\n\nAlong the 4 day journey around Taiwan with Deanna, I found it fascinating to see the difference between rural life and city life, which became the concept of this story.  We went to Taiwan's second-biggest city called Kaohsiung to uncover the differences between Taiwan’s rural areas and its bustling cities. I was mesmerized by the amazing temples and delicious food! Finally, we made our way to Taipei where I take you on a journey to understand the wacky (yet fun) culture and experience a night market - one of the singular best things about Taiwan.  \n\nThis is my Taiwan story, go create yours: https://www.mytaiwanstory.com/\n\nP.S. - There are a few minor corrections to the video that I want to make - thank you to those who helped fact-check!\n\n1) At 1:40: Taiwan was under Japanese colonial rule from 1895 and left in 1945 at the end of World War II.\n2) At 1:35: I misspoke - The Spanish and Dutch colonies were actually in the 17th century.\n\nThank you for watching and I'll see you next week!\n\nFollow @drewbinsky for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#Taiwan #Asia #travel \n\n👕 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO 🌎: https://shopjustgo.com/\n\n👫 JOIN over 33,000 people in our JUST GO APP!  https://bit.ly/3iAZlnw\n✈️ BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n► IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY Country in the world (197/197).

This video is looooong overdue.\n\nI've spent more time in South Korea (22 months) than any other country besides the U.S.A.  I find South Korean culture to be one of the strangest, yet most exciting and fascinating cultures in the world. \n\nWhen I taught English in South Korea, I was living in a small village (called Jin-sa-ri) about 40 miles south of Seoul.  I was one of 4 foreigners in my town, so it's safe to say I know Korean culture very well... Nobody spoke a lick of English in my town, so therefore, I learned how to speak Korean conversationally.  I also trained to get a black belt in Taekwondo.  Some of my best memories in my early 20s are in South Korea. \n\nThis video represents some of the most interesting and wacky things I find about Korean culture. \n\nHave you ever been to South Korea?

But for all the lovers of this fruit, and believe me, there are MANY -- it's almost like a 'cult following' where people are extremely addicted to eating it. \n\nDurian is only found in Southeast Asia, where it naturally grows, and MALAYSIA is known to be the birthplace of the fruit. In other words, the durian you will find in Malaysia is the best in the world. \n\nToday, I met up with a wonderful Malaysian family in K.L. (whom I met 10 months ago in Seoul) and they took me out to their favorite durian 'warehouse' -- the mecca for durian eaters. To be honest, I enjoyed durian a lot more this time than my previous 6 or 7 times eating it! \n\nHave you ever tried durian before? Did you like it or hate it?

At the time, the locals had no idea how to properly mine gold... and now, about 3,000 people are making a VERY healthy living doing it.\n\nFrom what I have seen today, digging for gold all day in this humidity (and heavy rain) is EXTREMELY difficult, but the best ones are making up to $3,000 a day.   For all you math wizards, that's over 1 million dollars a year.\n\nHere is the full story of the gold miners in the Solomon Islands.

Also, McDonald's always has clean bathrooms, A/C, strong wifi, outlets to charge my phone, and the McCafé is a nice working environment. \n\nLet me make one thing clear -- when I travel, I eat local foods 99% of the time. But when I'm overseas for months and months at a time, I get sick of the local food, and I resort to McDonald’s. And every time, it hits the spot. \n\nHave you ever eaten at McDonald's abroad?

So I put together this video with my honest thoughts and opinions of the country after a 3-month solo backpacking trip in early 2015. \n\nI have a love-hate relationship with India, as it is a very complex and intense country to visit.

Seeing the Taj Mahal was as amazing as tragic from the fatal bus crash I was involved in. \n\nIndia challenges you in every possible way, both physically and mentally. It brings out your true colors, your emotions, your thoughts -- and I learned more about myself in those 3 months than I have over the last 3 years. \n\nLuckily, I just discovered a ton of GoPro footage that I took on that trip (which I haven't ever seen until now!) Join me as I reminisce about this trip from exactly 3 years ago.\n\nIf you've been to India, I'd love to get your thoughts and feedback on my video. Can you relate to my experiences? What were your favorite parts and biggest challenges?\n\n#india #asia #travel \n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

It is Kazakhstan's newly designated capital (1998) which moved from Almaty, and over the last 20 years, it has rapidly developed from basically nothing into an international hub with many skyscrapers and futuristic buildings.    \n\nIn this video, find out which strange new foods I ate in Kazakhstan, and what else I got for $10!\n\nPlease Note that this video is over a year old (I am reposting the entire '$10 series' as I only shared it on FB and not YT).

        "description": "This was the single scariest travel moment of my life - getting detained on the border of North Korea & Russia. Sitting in that military compound for 3 hours, alone, without my phone or my friends, was absolutely terrifying. \n\nAs many of you already know, I am fascinated by North Korea. I spent 4 days in Pyongyang in 2017 and I can even speak the Korean language (I lived in South Korea for 2 years).  Not a day goes by where I don’t ponder about life in North Korea - the strangest and most isolated country in the world.\n\nBut Americans have been banned to visit North Korea since 2017 - a few months after I left. In fact, I think that I’m one of the last few Americans to step foot in the country. \n\nSo I wanted to attempt to go back while traveling in Siberia.  And what happened to me is something that I’ve never experienced and I’ll never forget.\n\nThis is the full story of how I got detained on the North Korea / Russia border. The journey starts in the far Eastern city of Vladivostok.  \n\nThank you so much to my local friend Natasha for joining me on this wild adventure.

THIRTY PERCENT BY AGE 10.\n\nAs a result, tobacco-related deaths are around 300,000 every year among Indonesians, and it's rapidly growing at a scary rate.\n\nIt's my 6th time in Indonesia and I can't help but notice how SO MANY people have cigarettes dangling out of their lips.

Shirts & Hats available: https://shop.drewbinsky.com/\n\nI JUST VISITED THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS SLUM IN VENEZUELA and it was one of the craziest experiences of my life.  It's called Petare, and it's basically a sub-district of Caracas with a population of over 1 million people who live on the top of a mountain.  \n\nNone of my local Venezuelan friends ever had the courage to venture deep inside Petare before, but together we decided to give it a try and it was eye-opening to say the least.  We ended up making a local friend, Marquito, who showed us around, invited us into his home, and introduced us to his family & friends.  \n\nThere was one moment on the street where things got pretty tense, but other than that, it was safer than I expected and it was a humbling experience to meet with the people and feel their energy.  Even though they may not have much, they are very friendly and welcoming people and I would go back in a heartbeat. \n\nFollow @drewbinsky for more stories from every country, and join me on Instagram: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Travel #Venezuela\n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

        "description": "Ever since I took a class in college about “The History of North Korea,” I have been obsessed with the country. In April 2017, I had the rare opportunity to be one of the only Americans to spend 4 days in North Korea’s capital city of Pyongyang. There's no question that it's the most isolated and interesting place on earth.\n\nIn my early 20s, I spent 2 years living and teaching English in Seoul (South Korea) and I fell in love with Korean culture.  To this day, I have a strong admiration for the entire Korean peninsula - its people, cuisine and lifestyle. \n\nWhen I heard about a North Korean refugee named Munho - who escaped only a few years ago and found asylum in Thailand, I immediately contacted him.  All of the 10 North Korean defectors that I've met in my life are female, with similar stories - so I knew this one would be special.  Munho and I chatted on What's App for more than a year before this story was actually filmed. \n\nMunho is an amazing guy and we had a BLAST wandering around Seoul together - comparing and contrasting life between North Korea and South Korea.  \n\nThis is the very first time that Munho has publicly shared his escape story, and I'd like to thank him for being so kind, humble and open.  He will be reading all of your comments, so please let us know your thoughts and reactions to this video, and to Munho's personal story!  Thanks for watching and see you next week!\n\n#Korea #travel \n\n✅  Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE to my channel by clicking here ➞   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Ize0RLIbGdH5x4wI45G-A\n\n▶️ Watch my favorite videos ➞ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhiP3P44ul3Y8LDbhXJmhVsVWcpe-7O4O\n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

I'm sure you are aware that since 2011, Yemen has been in a constant state of war.  Tourists are not welcome here, and it's extremely risky for any traveler to visit at this moment -- especially as both an American and a journalist. I am double at risk.\n\nThat all being said, I am beyond excited to have this rare opportunity to take you inside one of the most hidden and raw cultures left on earth.  My first 24 hours have already been one hell of an emotional ride (as you'll see in this video) -- and you will be hearing lots more over the coming week. \n\nYou won't want to miss this series, trust me!\n\n#yemen #travel #middleeast \n\nIf you're on Instagram, join me on IG Stories for more updates: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

And this time around was a lot more enjoyable!

The people of Pakistan are incredibly warm and hospitable, and they will literally break their backs to make sure that I am enjoying myself in their country.  \n\nI've never experienced this kind of hospitality in my life. \n\nAm I saying that Pakistan is 100%?  Not at all.  You need to take normal precautions, just like you would do anywhere else in the world.  But what I am trying to tell you is that the reputation you've heard in the media about Pakistan is completely and utterly false.  \n\nI am absolutely LOVING Pakistan so far, and I can't wait to see more over the coming 8 days!  \n\nP.S. -- For the record, nobody told me to make this video and it is not sponsored by anyone.  These are my 100% honest feelings from my experience in Pakistan so far.  The truth is that I can never say enough about how amazing Pakistan is.

I am so overwhelmed by the amazing people who welcomed me here -- you won't believe the stories that I'm about to share with you. \n\nEver since the war began in Syria in 2011, the media has ripped this country into pieces (not surprisingly) -- so I am going to do my best to show you the positive sides of Syrian people, culture, food, and general life -- because trust me, there are A LOT of positives that are yet to be exposed to the outside world.  \n\nCan you guys sense how excited I am as I type this right now? It's unbelievable what I am feeling right now. \n\nThis first video is somewhat of an overview of everything I did in Syria.  You can consider it as a 'teaser' for what's to come.   I will be uploading daily videos as usual, but please note they will be delayed 14 days as I decided not to post live for safety reasons and so I could fully enjoy the trip without feeling pressure to upload. \n\nI HOPE YOU ENJOY THESE SYRIA VIDEOS, and please comment below with thoughts/comments/opinions about travel in Syria and I'll do my best to get back to you. \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky right now on IG STORIES to watch my trip unfold behind the scenes! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#syria #drewbinsky #travel \n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

        "description": "In 2018, I had the pleasure of visiting 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  I absolutely love this continent.  It offers incredible nature, culture, and experiences that you cannot find anywhere else.  \n\nIn a sense, I feel like traveling to Africa is the only \"real\" traveling that I've ever done.\n\nBut I have noticed a lot of scamming and bribery happening to me in African countries lately, and that's why I made this video. \n\nI know this post will get a lot of hate mail, and that's okay.  I want to hear your opinions, thoughts, and suggestions on this subject.\n\nI could lie to you guys and say that Africa is 100% safe as a non-black person, but that's just not the case.  Perhaps it would be safer if I didn't travel solo, but I always have. \n\nThe point of this video is that if you physically stand out in any place, you will be treated differently.  And I wish someday, in this amazing world of ours, that this will not be the case.\n\n#africa #travel #race \n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

        "description": "Red Telephone Booths? English Speaking? Fish 'n Chips?\n\nThat's the Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) in a nutshell -- THEY ARE SHOCKINGLY BRITISH, more so than anywhere I've been in Great Britain. I cannot tell you how bizarre it is to be 8,000 miles away from the U.K., and feel this strong of a British influence in the small archipelago called the Falkland Islands.\n\nAs many of you may know, the history of the Falkland Islands is complicated and bloody... The sovereignty of the islands is part of an ongoing dispute between the U.K. and nearby Argentina, as it was fought out over a brutal 10-week war in 1982, which ultimately led to Argentina surrendering. The conflict still exists today, more than you might imagine.\n\nI made this video to teach you a little about the history of the Falkland Islands, as well as show you some things I've discovered and learned over the last 3 days I spent here with Hurtigruten. Have I mentioned that the nature and wildlife in the Falkland Islands is breathtaking?!\n\nJust out of curiosity -- did you already know about the British influence of the Falkland Islands?

Guys - I have been coming to the Philippines for the last 8 years and I've traveled to more than 50 Filipino islands - but I'm telling you that nothing compares to what I experienced in Tawi Tawi. \n\nThe Badjao (Bajau) people are so kind and genuine, despite not even having a Jollibee in their community (it's hard to find this around the country!).  I hope you enjoy watching this story and I welcome any of your comments or questions in the comments below!\n\nAlso, in case you were wondering, I found multiple sources online showing that the Badjaos (Bajaus) can hold their breath for up to 13 minutes, including a National Geographic article which you can also search for on Google.

The self-declared micro-nation that sits on a mysterious 7km plot of land on the border of Serbia and Croatia? If not, then you will be absolutely shocked by what I'm about to share with you in this 33-minute video - one of my favorite stories of the year! \n\nThe 'country' of Liberland was founded in 2015 by a Czech libertarian named Vít Jedlička, and it was built on one simple principle: FREEDOM.  More than 900 citizens already have their Liberland passports (yes, they are real!!), and this legal document allows them to enter several U.N. countries such as Haiti, Malawi and Colombia. Word on the street is spreading, and now more than 700,000 people are on the list to get their e-residency cards. \n\nI recently went to Liberland's annual festival called 'Floating Man,' and I was really inspired by the conversations that I had.  There were so many creative and forward-thinking minds in one place, with a lot of optimism for the future of Liberland to gain full independence.  But one thing didn't feel right to me... It is extremely difficult to enter the physical land.  \n\nBoth the Serbian and Croatian border police are guarding Liberland 24-7, along the banks of the Danube River, and they will arrest anyone who tries to step foot on the land itself.  \n\nIn this video, I uncover the full Liberland story and go on a wild mission to land on its soil. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on Liberland? Would love to hear in the comments below.

If not, don't feel embarrassed... because it's a very tiny country in the Horn of Africa that gets minimal tourism -- roughly 70,000 visitors per year. \n\nOver the last 2 days, I have explored every facet of the capital & biggest city called Djibouti City. I find this place to be the most interesting country in Africa. \n\nHere are some of my quick realizations:\n\n- It's VERY EXPENSIVE -- I have spent more than $400 in the last 2 days and I haven't done much other than walk around, take a few taxis, eat 4 meals & sleep (keep in mind my visa was $90 and my hotel was $105).\n\n- Walking around the streets feels very much like France, from the colonization period that started in 1884 and ended in 1977. The people here speak French (first), Arabic (second) and English (third, if any at all). \n\n- There is a LOT OF SECURITY everywhere -- police/military guards standing on every corner (literally) with giant guns strapped to their backs. It is kind of crazy and very intimidating, but safe. \n\n- About a quarter of Djibouti's population (~250,000 people) are living in extreme poverty, which is more extreme than you'd think given that this country is so expensive. A massive contrast between rich & poor.\n\nAll of my thoughts on this mysterious country, and more, are in this video.

The government lifted restrictions TODAY and I am thrilled to be able to experience this untouched society. \n\nIf you've never heard of Kashmir before, it's a disputed territory of some 13 million people that lies in the Himalayan mountains in between Northern India, Northern Pakistan and Western China.  Each of the 3 countries claims ownership in the land, which is what has caused all the recent controversy.\n\nBut all politics aside, this place is SO AMAZING and I am loving the culture out here.

Doctors said she wouldn't be able to walk for 4 years, but she managed to overcome this feat after just 7 months.  Moreover, she had recently converted to Islam and used the religion to help her stay positive and focus on her recovery.  \n\nWhether you are religious or not, it's truly amazing what religion can do to help someone reach their goals.

It might be the most electric and vibrant city in the world.\n\nThis is the 5th sequel to my “$100 in 24 Hours” series — but I think it’s the best one because Istanbul is MUCH cheaper than the previous few cities (Hong Kong and Barcelona)... The affordability enabled me to go ALL OUT on a $100 budget — kebabs, kumpir, coffee, baklava, tea, shisha, Efes beer and TONS MORE!\n\nLastly, the fact that I got into Istanbul, Turkey is a MIRACLE ... Have you heard about the Turkey/USA mutual visa ban?! Just 3 hours before my plane arrived in Istanbul (literally), all U.S citizens were banned from visiting Turkey indefinitely (the Turkish government mimicked the U.S.'s ban last week which prohibited Turkish citizens from entering the USA). I read this news while sitting on the runway in Tel Aviv, and I was so nervous that I was gonna get detained, deported and/or questioned by the Turkish immigration, but I made it in safely!!! I think I was the last American to get a visa on arrival. I hope this stupid visa ban goes away, and both U.S. and Turkish citizens are able to visit each other's country again. I hate politics.\n\n#turkey #istanbul #travel \n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

And I'm beyond excited to take you behind-the-scenes of India over the next 10 days, as we road trip from Kochi to Chennai.  \n\nThere's a huge misconception that India is \"unsafe\" for travelers (especially women travelers), and that is just plain wrong.  \n\nI spent 3 months on the Indian subcontinent 4 years ago, and now after being back for just a few days, I am reminded how safe India really is.   Everyone is always smiling at you!\n\nYou can walk outside at night, alone.  You can wander down alleys.  You can approach random people (if they don't approach you first).  You can jump in a random taxi.  The chances of something bad happening to you are very, very slim.  And that's the biggest takeaway I want you to get.\n\nHave you ever been to India?

It's a tiny country of 800,000 people, sandwiched between India and China in the Himalayan mountains.\n\nI arrived here in Bhutan just 2 days ago, and it has REALLY fascinated me in terms of cleanliness, friendliness and natural beauty. \n\nBhutan is unique. Bhutan is innovative. Bhutan takes great measures to protect its cultural identity and natural environment, which consists of 72% forest. \n\nThere are many other things that Bhutan does, which put them in another league when compared to the rest of the world. \n\nBHUTAN IS THE WORLD'S ONLY COUNTRY WHO:\n- has banned the sale and consumption of tobacco\n- absorbs more CO2 than it gives out, making them 'carbon negative'\n- The largest export is renewable energy\n- measures their country's prosperity by happiness, not wealth\n- can sentence you to life in prison for killing an endangered animal\n\nProtecting their environment has had a positive correlation with the happiness of its people -- Bhutan consistently ranks as the happiest country in Asia and top 10 in the world overall. Maybe the rest of the world should take Bhutan's lead?\n\nIn this video, I did my best to sum up Bhutan in less than 4 minutes. This will be the first of 5 (possibly 6) videos on the country.

I feel like this documentary takes me back to my roots in storytelling.  It's a piece that I've been wanting to tell for more than 5 years now, and I'm so glad by how it turned out!  \n\nI just spent 2 days living with the Mundari Tribe in rural SOUTH SUDAN and it was an incredible and humbling experience.  After spending most of my life in busy cities, it was so refreshing to witness how the Mundari's live such simple, genuine lives - far removed from the stresses of the Western World - yet they remain so happy and so close to nature.  \n\nThe Mundaris are known as the “Cow Tribe” because they live among their cows (literally, thousands of them) and utilize their cattle for food, trade, dowry and survival.  After spending 48 hours with the Mundari tribe, I learned that it's the simple moments in life that matter most - like family time and laughter. \n\nI actually posted this video on YouTube a few weeks ago, but it got flagged and demonetized for various parts (i.e. the urine shower), so my team and I have blurred out all of the best parts (sadly) and this is the PG-13 version that you are watching.

Long story short, the country is split between 20% native English speakers (i.e. Anglophones) and 80% native French. The Anglophones have been calling for equal rights as the French, and this tension has led to over 1,000 deaths and 150,000+ others forced to leave their homes for safer regions.\n\nI arrived here in Douala (Cameroon's biggest city) a few days ago and I've been learning about the current political situation, and it's a lot worse than I imagined. In a city called Buea, which is in the English-speaking region,  recent fighting has been taking place.  I ventured inside that area, passing numerous police checkpoints who were heavily armed, and I saw burned-down cars and bullets on the ground. It was bizarre.\n\nThis video is a brief overview of what Cameroon is facing right now. Please share to spread awareness, because no violence should go unnoticed.

He's one of the greatest professional boxers of all time and a very popular Senator of the Philippines.\n\nI was told that I'd only have 2 minutes to speak with him (because he's so busy), but he gave me more than ONE HOUR of his time one-on-one.   I was so surprised to discover how interested he is in Judaism, and he can even speak Hebrew!  \n\nI really hope that this video turns into a sequel, where I can join him on his upcoming trip to Israel.  Can you imagine how awesome that would be?\n\nAre there any Manny Pacquiao fans out there?  All I can say is that he's one of the kindest, most genuine people I've ever met.  And I can't believe that he's STILL competing at 40 years old!   \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for more fun behind the scenes: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#mannypacquiao #philippines #travel \n\nFIND ME ON:\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► TIK TOK: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n► FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► YOUTUBE 2ND CHANNEL: https://rb.gy/a65sj\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY country in the world (197/197).

In this video, my local friend Bram and I take you on a journey through the streets of Baarle, exploring its rich history, culture, and unique characteristics.\n\nAs we walk through the village, you'll notice that the border between the two countries is not always clear, with some houses and even streets divided between the Netherlands and Belgium. This is due to a series of land disputes and treaties dating back to the Middle Ages, which have resulted in the unusual configuration of Baarle.\n\nBut Baarle is not just about its border and history, the village offers a wonderful array of cultural experiences from live music, theater and art events. Some of the local festivals and events you can expect to find include the annual cherry blossom festival, where you can enjoy live music, food and activities for the whole family, and the Christmas market, which is a perfect place to find unique gifts and enjoy the festive atmosphere.\n\nWe also take you to some of the most beautiful and interesting places in and around Baarle. From the St. Willibrordus church, which dates back to the 11th century, to the nearby nature reserve, where you can enjoy a peaceful stroll or bike ride.\n\nThis video is a must-see for anyone interested in history, culture, and unique experiences. So hit the subscribe button and join us as we discover the hidden gems of Baarle, a village like no other.\n\nPS - The highlight of the story was visiting 97-year-old bartender, Nel, who has been working at the same bar for over 70 years! Can you believe that? If you ever visit Baarle, please visit her and tell her that I say hi! \n\nFollow @drewbinsky for more stories from EVERY country!\n\n#netherlands #belgium #travel \n\n👕 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO 🌎: https://shopjustgo.com/\n\n👫 JOIN over 33,000 people in our JUST GO APP!  https://bit.ly/3iAZlnw\n✈️ BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n► IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY Country in the world (197/197).

I met him earlier today on the streets of Bujumbura, Burundi, and his story is just about as inspiring as they come!\n\nShabani grew up poor and with 2 functioning legs.  About 10 years ago, he had a medical problem which has caused him to be in wheelchair forever...  But that didn't stop him from giving up, it only gave him more motivation.  He began selling airtime (phone credits) at a busy intersection in the city, and worked his way up to doing $16,000 USD of business a month.  He recently bought himself a piece of land, built a house, and has bigger plans for his future.    \n\nThis is a story of never giving up, and I can't wait to follow up with Shabani the next time I'm in Burundi! \n\nIf anyone wants to send a message to Shabani or wish him a Merry Christmas, please write it below and I will show him the comment section of this video later! \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG STORIES for more content behind the scenes: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

Well, not only did I just visit that exact place where the two rivers meet (in the center of Iraq), but I ventured deep into BABYLON.  This ancient civilization dates back to the 19th Century BC, and is absolutely mind-blowing.   The best part is that my buddy Alvaro and I were THE ONLY ONES THERE. \n\nIf these ruins were in a country like Italy or Spain, then they would be the most visited sites on earth... But sadly, we are deep in the heart of Iraq, a nation that has been torn apart by war and turmoil over the last 30 years. \n\nI've been to 194 countries and I've seen a lot of cool things and places, but this ranks up there as one of the best.  It might just be number 1.  It's really hard to put into words the feeling of walking these grounds, which are still being excavated to this day. \n\nI hope that you guys enjoy our adventure around Babylon and that you learn something new.  I am so grateful to have this platform and be able to share my experiences with you, because so few outsiders get to come here.

We ate 3 delicious lunches and were about to wrap up the day... until we came across Uncle Tokyo's street food stall on the corner. \n\nI sat there in amazement, watching him cook and craft these tasty treats called Khanom Tokyo, which are like mini-pancakes with either a sweet (custard) or savory (hot dog) filling.\n\nAfter observing Uncle Tokyo's work flow and asking him questions (through a translator, Mark's wife) -- I learned more about his story and couldn't help but make a video about him. \n\nHe's been cooking these EXACT same snacks on this EXACT same street corner for the last 20 years here in Bangkok. Every morning around 10AM, he wheels his push cart through the busy streets of Silom (Bangkok's business district) to set up his stall. Then he sells hundreds (if not thousands) of treats, before calling it a day at 2PM -- when the lunch crowd dies down. I never mentioned in the video, but the price of these things are about $0.25 USD each.\n\nUncle Tokyo is representative of the countless other street vendors around Bangkok who work hard mastering one single dish... but NOBODY is as funny and playful as him!\n\nWhat a guy, what a story, and I hope you enjoy watching. If you want to find his stall, it's on Convent Road nearby Exit 2 of Sala Daeng BTS station. If you do go there, please show him this video as I have no way of contacting him!\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►Facebook @drewbinsky: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►Instagram @drewbinsky: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n►Twitter @drewbinsky: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \nteam (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

        "description": "DID YOU KNOW that a town called Bamiyan in Afghanistan marks the Westernmost expansion of Buddhism in the history of the world?\n\nWay back in the 4th Century, people in Bamiyan carved two MASSIVE Buddha statues (literally) into the mountain and they stood strong for 1,600+ years, until they were ruthlessly destroyed by the Taliban in 2001...  It's one of the saddest stories known to mankind, but it was still an incredible sight to visit!  \n\nAfter spending 3 days in Bamiyan,  I am COMPLETELY AMAZED by the nature around this mountainous area, as well as the amazing people who have welcomed me here with open arms!  For decades, Bamiyan has been recognized as the safest and most stable place in Afghanistan -- which certainly felt like the truth when I was there a few weeks ago... but then the horrible news came that 2 bomb blasts rocked the main marketplace -- where much of this video was shot. \n\nIt breaks my heart that the innocent people of Afghanistan must risk their lives every time they step outside.

        "description": "Welcome to ETHIOPIA - my favorite country in Africa! It's so nice to be here with Deanna, our 76th country together!  We have a very special story to tell you from the historic city of Harar, near the border with Somalia.  There is a man named Abbas, and along with his father Yusuf, are the only people in the world who live with (and feed) wild hyenas. Every single night, they spend about $40 USD collecting raw camel and cow meat from local butchers and use it to feed their wild hyenas.  They are so close with their hyenas that they have named all of them, and the bond is something I've never seen before. \n\nThis is truly a wild story from a corner of Ethiopia that you may have never heard of before, and I'm really grateful to be able to share it with you today.  I'd love to hear from you in the comments below - what do you think of the hyena man? Would you ever come here? Or feed them with your mouth, if given the chance?\n\n#Ethiopia #Africa #Travel\n\n✅ SUBSCRIBE for More Travel Videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n📝 Get My Top 100 Travel Pics FREE! https://bit.ly/3Fsk0qo\n\nThanks again to Anker for sponsoring this video #Anker #AnkerPrime #ChargeEverythingFaster.

Many of you have been asking about Noor -- my beloved Afghan friend and tour guide.   I spent every moment of 4 weeks traveling around Afghanistan with him by my side --  he's one of the most sincere and down-to-earth people I've ever met, who has a passion for sharing the beauty of his country.   \n\nI've stayed silent to protect Noor's safety, but now I'm so happy to break the news that he and his family have arrived safely in Melbourne, Australia!  They managed to get on one of the final evacuation military airplanes out of Kabul. I was able to catch up with Noor via Zoom yesterday, and he shared the harrowing details of escaping Kabul at the last second.   Here is our full conversation. \n\nORGANIZATIONS TO DONATE TO:\n\nIf you'd like to donate to help those in Afghanistan, please see the following 2 links.  If you aren't able to donate, don't worry, because just by watching this vide,o you are helping -- all proceeds will be sent to both fundraisers. \n\n1. https://fundly.com/support-afghan-guides-and-fixers-1\n\nThis was started by my friend Matt with an attempt to get all Afghan tour guides, fixers and drivers to safety (Noor's colleagues).   All funds will support transportation, resettlement, and general humanitarian needs for those displaced or trying to leave the country. \n\n2. https://www.stimulus.app/campaigns/afghan-women-in-danger/\n\nThis was started by my friend and fellow traveler Omid.  It's urgent aid for Afghan women refugees. They have partnered with \"Women For Afghan Women\" to identify refugees who have recently landed in the US.  All donations go directly to these women and families. They provide cash grants starting at $300 per person to help with their transition.\n\nThank you for watching, and I'll see you on Sunday with the next episode from Mauritania. \n\n#Afghanistan #Refugee #Kabul\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n► IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nSyria's capital of Damascus is widely considered as the oldest continuously inhabited city on earth, with evidence of habitation dating back (at least) 11,000 years.  For all you math wizards out there, that's about 10,000 B.C.!\n\nThis is largely due to the unique positioning of the city -- in the heart of the Middle East, in the center of the world and at the intersection of 3 continents.  Damascus was conquered by Alexander the Great in 333 BCE, and since then, it's been taken over by dozens of empires such as Roman, Arab and Ottoman.\n\nI have spent the first few days of my trip in Syria in this amazing city, and I'm loving it so much that I wanted to dedicate an entire video to show you what it's like to visit.  \n\nOne thing that I didn't mention much in the video is about how SAFE it is in Damascus.  I can't speak yet for the rest of Syria, but as far as this city goes (in this current day), I feel extremely safe just like I do in any other big city around the world.  \n\nMORE TO COME SOON! \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for exclusive content that isn't shown in my videos:  \nhttps://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

But you all know what beaches and resorts look like... so I wanted to show you the opposite side of the Seychelles -- the local life -- which I came to realize is very minimal. The capital city (town) of Victoria has merely 25,000 people, making it the smallest capital in Africa and one of the smallest in the world.\n\nThe Seychelles is also VERY EXPENSIVE, so making this video was quite hard... But nonetheless, join me in my 15th episode of this series to see 'how much you can get with $10 USD' in the Seychelles.\n\nHave you ever been to the Seychelles? Please share your experiences in the Seychelles below!\n\nP.S. -- This video was one of the hardest I've ever made. I nearly gave up, as it's been pouring rain all day and it happens to be a national holiday in the Seychelles, meaning almost everything is closed. As I have been limited on what I could do and see here, I apologize if this episode is less entertaining than my usual ones!

I never expected this!!!\n\nSince 1991, my birth year, Somaliland has been a self-declared region of Somalia and has been seeking international independence since then (which it truly deserves to get). They have their own government, currency, flag, military, and I even had to get a separate Somaliland visa to get inside.\n\nSomaliland strikes a drastic contrast with its neighbor as a land of peace, democratic stability and safety.\n\nI am not just saying this to sound cool, or for the video's sake, but SOMALILAND IS THE SAFEST I'VE FELT OVER THE LAST 2 MONTHS IN AFRICA. By a long shot. I can walk the streets freely at night without worrying about a thing. I have not felt pressure, once, from people trying to scam me. Everyone is so friendly, honest, and welcoming. It's also very cheap, which is a breath of fresh air for me.\n\nThis video accurately displays my thoughts and first impressions of Somaliland -- I can't wait to explore more around this country all week long!\n\nThank you to my friends at Damal Hotel in Hargeisa for the incredible hospitality! \n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \nteam (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

Welcome to Kandahar, Afghanistan. \n\nKandahar is well known as being the headquarters of a Sunni Islamic political movement and military organization who is currently waging war within the country.    Since their uprising in the mid 1990s, Kandahar has been the home base where the group operates, and at one point in time (in the early 2000s), they controlled 95% of the country. \n\nI didn’t originally plan to visit Kandahar on this trip around Afghanistan, but the city recently opened up (about a year ago) and there was a spontaneous opportunity to go there… And I couldn’t decline it.\n\nSo why did I go to Kandahar, knowing that it is dangerous?   \n\nDespite all of the battle and conflict that the city has seen over the last 25 years, I knew that there is another side to the Kandahar story among its 1 million residents.  Having the chance to meet eye-to-eye with these innocent people, observing their lifestyle and witnessing the ancient wonders of Kandahar was enough motivation for me to go.  \n\nAnd after spending 48 hours in the city, all I can say is that it turned out to be one of the most incredible few days of my life.  \n\nIn this video, join me on a wild journey into Kandahar, Afghanistan. \n\nFollow @Drew Binsky   for more stories from every country, and join me on Instagram! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Afghanistan #Travel\n\nTEXT ME and I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\nGet your music on Musicbed!

I recently traveled to Laos, which in my opinion, is Asia’s Greatest Mystery. Nobody knows what’s happening in Laos, as it gets massively overlooked by its neighbors of Thailand and Vietnam.  \n\nWhile in Laos for my second visit, I had a goal to find the most remote tribe in the country —  which led me to the Akha tribe. They live fascinating, remote lives up in the mountains and they have the most incredible traditional dresses.  I actually had to take a domestic flight up North to a tiny town called Luang Namtha, and then drive 7 hours across a bumpy dirt road to find them.  And yes, they really have never had a foreign visitor!\n\nThe Akha tribe lives on the border of China and Myanmar - that’s how remote I was!  It was such a fascinating experience to spend a few days with them. I was pleased to discover that they are holding on to their traditions, even as modernization is slowly creeping in. \n\nThis is a story of family, happiness and FUN.  Thank you for watching. \n\nPS - this was supposed to be part 2 of my TRIBES series, but now it’s Part 1 because my South Sudan ‘Cow Tribe’ video got flagged and demonetized on YouTube.  I’ll keep you posted on how/where you’ll be able to watch that video soon. \n\nThese tribe stories are my favorite, and they’re at my core of storytelling.

I had no idea what would unfold when I knocked on their door.  Maybe it was going to be an awkward day with little conversation?  Maybe the food wouldn't be tasty?  ...

All of these things are what makes our relationship so unique.\n\nBecause of our different backgrounds, things are always interesting no matter what we are doing.

And when I go abroad, I like to venture deep off the beaten path to find interesting stories to tell. \n\nNothing piques my interest more than drugs -- where they are found and how they are used around the world. Alcohol, nicotine and marijuana are consumed literally everywhere (even in countries where it's banned). But if you think those drugs are abused, just wait until you learn about KHAT (found in the Horn of Africa/Arabian peninsula) and BETEL NUT (found in Southeast Asia/ Pacific Islands). \n\nI discovered both of these heavily addicting drugs in Somaliland and Papua New Guinea, respectively, earlier this year. This video shares the story of how they are affecting the local population and how they contribute to a massive part of each country's economy.\n\nHave you ever heard of these two drugs before? What are your thoughts on them? \n\n\nP.S. -- Just FYI, I tried both khat and betel nut once simply because I was curious to find out how it makes you feel.

Schools, hospitals, apartment complexes, parks, markets are left in ruins.  It has been really hard to witness.\n\nBUT, reconstruction of Aleppo is now in full swing, and that's what I have decided to focus on in this video.  The markets are coming back to life, the street vendors are out, and shop owners are remodeling their stores to how they used to be a decade ago.   Have I mentioned that Aleppo cuisine is considered the best in Syria (and trust me, it's the truth!)\n\nAlso -- the Aleppo Citadel (the oldest in the world) still remains in great shape and it was wonderful to explore, and see the 360 degree view of the city from the top. \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, I encourage you to share it with your friends and family.

Let me tell you, the Maldives is a beautiful place!\n\nMany people don't look beyond the luxury resorts & private beaches in the Maldives, but I've come to realize that A THRIVING LOCAL LIFE does exists here, on about 200 islands (15% of the Maldives' total islands). \n\nEarlier this morning, we arrived on a gorgeous local Maldivian island called Maafushi, and despite the heavy winds & pouring rain (it's the start of rainy season...) -- I managed to get a nice glimpse of how the people of the Maldives live their day-to-day lives. \n\nI met up with two awesome Instagrammers from the Maldives, Ishan and Sotti, who took me around to experience the hidden gems of Maafushi.\n\nWe ate coconuts, went to cafes, roamed the quiet streets, visited Mosques and even had a home-cooked meal in one of their friend's houses.\n\nIt's a humbling time of the year to visit the Maldives, because it is Ramadan -- the holiest month of the Muslim religion, where people fast everyday from sunrise to sunset. It was beautiful to witness \"Iftar\" or \"breaking the fast\" at exactly 6:13PM outside of the main Mosque. The people were so friendly, taking me by the hand and giving me free food. I loved it. \n\nToday was a very special birthday, and a day that I'll never forget. Thank you to all the new friends I made here, and I can't wait to go island hopping with you all tomorrow! \n\nHave you ever been to the Maldives?

This is the site of the world's largest pilgrimage, where every October, over 15 MILLION Shia Muslims walk from neighboring countries to show respect to Imam Hussain's shrine (grandson of prophet Muhammad).   Even though I am not visiting in October, I can feel the spirit in the air unlike any place I've ever been. \n\nThe mosques and mausoleums are STUNNING, and somehow, I got special VIP access into the back room to meet with the boss... and he gave me permission to film inside.  This kind of permission is unheard of!\n\nBut my favorite thing about Karbala is the hospitality. You've probably noticed a theme by now - that the Middle East has the most hospitable people in the world and a perfect example of this is Karbala! \n\nThe main mosque provides hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of FREE meals to anyone who stops by.   I've never seen anything like it in my life... And not only that, but the local people will open their doors to all visitors.  \n\nWe randomly got invited into a family's home where they cooked us a 10 course meal. \n\nAll of that and more in this amazing episode, which I hope will change your perspective about Iraq.  \n\nIf you're still reading this, just know that I love you and thanks so much for watching my videos and supporting me over the years.  I am in my happiest place right now, traveling through Iraq proper, and I'm just so grateful to be able to share these stories with you.

Everest -- but did you know that Nepal has a fascinating culture and it's one of the most budget-friendly countries in all of Asia?  Nepal is often overlooked by its neighboring countries (India), but you should really give it a chance on your next trip to Asia! \n\nThe first time I tried visiting Nepal (April 25, 2015), I was literally on the airplane (from Delhi) when the devastating 7.9 earthquake struck, and therefore had to cancel my trip.  It was very scary as I felt the rumbles on the runway in Delhi.  But nonetheless, I was so happy to get the chance to explore Kathmandu, Nepal for the first time and make the next episode of my $10 series. \n\nPlease Note that this video is about a year old (I am reposting the entire '$10 series' as I only shared it on FB and not YT).  As you'll notice, the editing is not great and it moves way too fast, but I still wanted to share it with you anyways.

WHO KNEW IT'S THIS AMAZING?\n\nI've spent the last 4 days road tripping around the Northern Mediterranean coast of ALGERIA, and I have been absolutely stunned by what I've experienced.   From the warm hearts to the stunning nature and complete mix of cultures, I can safely say that this country is one of the most underrated in the world.\n\nAnd it's huge... REALLY HUGE.\n\nAfter Sudan split into two countries in 2011, Algeria emerged as the largest country in Africa by size.  It's so big that only 12% of the land is inhabited (with 44 million people), and over 90% of its surface is covered in the Sahara desert.  \n\nIf the visa wasn't so hard to get, then this country would explode in tourism.  But I kind of like it the way it is -- I didn't come across a single tourist during my time here. \n\nAlgeria is, without question, the most surprising country in Africa for me so far, and I know with certainty that I'll be back.

Find out in today's video of my Afghan German friend, Nadjma!\n\nThis is a video I've been wanting to make for a while.  It's about \"Third Culture Kids\" -- AKA people who are raised in a culture other than their parents' or the culture of the country on their passport during childhood.\n\nAt times, third culture kids may feel like they are living in two separate minds , or even worse, like they don't belong in the country they are living in... which is complete nonsense, because they should always be accepted as it was not their choice which life they were born into!\n\nToday I met Nadjma, an Afghan German, in Hamburg.

Moreover, did you know that nearly everyone here can speak a minimum of 3 languages FLUENTLY?\n\nThe humble people of Mauritius, all 1.2 million of them, are as diverse as I've seen in any single country. And that's because there is no indigenous population here -- every Mauritian today is a descendant from immigrants who came here centuries ago, mostly from India, France, Great Britain, East Africa (Madagascar) and China. \n\nAs a result, Mauritius is a melting pot of cultures, foods, religions, languages and ideas -- which is extra special for me because I love to dig deep into the local life! In today's video, see what I have discovered about the beautiful people of Mauritius.\n\nI can't wait to explore more about this lovely island! Have you ever been here before?

I am now in Cairo.\n\nThis past week in Yemen has been one of the most eye opening journeys of my life.  It was a roller coaster of emotions and I learned a lot about myself and the detrimental situation happening inside of this vulnerable Arabian nation.\n\nThis video recaps my thoughts on Yemen as I try to wrap my head around what I just experienced.  I also share my 2 cents on what I think needs to happen for Yemen to rebuild and come together moving forward.\n\nI will end my Yemen series by telling you this -- from the bottom of my heart, I had an amazing time in this country and I feel really bad for the people here.  They showed me nothing but kindness and respect, and it is horrible to witness the struggles that they are living through.  I will be keeping Yemen closely in my thoughts until things get better.

But as I've been wandering around the unique capital city of Windhoek, I couldn't help but notice how GERMAN everything feels. Seriously, the culture is bizarre here in Namibia! \n\nAs I investigated further, I discovered that Namibia was a German colony (from 1884 - 1915), and despite 103 years of separation since the Germans left, their influence is still deeply rooted in Namibian society today.\n\nI became so fascinated by this German-Namibian culture, because the vast majority of the world that I've seen has been conquered by either the British, French, Spanish, Portuguese or Dutch... Not the Germans. \n\nHere is a fun video I put together today all about my observations on German-influenced Namibia. \n\nJust out of curiosity -- Is this all news to you? Or did you know that Namibia is German-influenced?\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

The star center for the Boston Celtics, who originally comes from Turkey, is outspoken about his negative views on the regime of President Erdogan.\n\nAs a result, the Turkish officials have taken away his passport, labeled him as a 'terrorist' and put his name on the International Criminal Police Organization.     \n\nSince 2017, Enes Kanter has been trapped in the United States of America and is not able to cross any international borders until he (hopefully) is granted citizenship here in 2021. \n\nI was lucky enough to arrange a video call with Enes yesterday, and here is his full story --  it's a story of boldness and courage.

Moreover, did you know that Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of Queen, was born and raised here? There’s so much more uniqueness to this island that I can’t wait to share with you!\n\nI’ve spent the last 3 days in Zanzibar with a few of my best friends from home and a new local friend, Mandela. I cannot believe how perfect these white sand beaches are, combined with a very simple life, lots of fresh fruit (PINEAPPLES) and Rastafarian beach parties — I could easily spend a few months here.\n\nIn this video, I aim to educate you about the diverse history of Zanzibar, show you some fun activities happening around the island, and tell you what to expect if you are planning to come here.\n\nHave you ever been to Zanzibar?\n\nMusic: Audio Autix\n\nP.S - Watch until the very end to learn some Swahili words!!!\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post more videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \nteam@drewbinsky.com",

Tonight around 9PM, while I was walking on the streets of Kochi in the Southern Indian state of Kerala, I heard extremely loud banging sounds.  It sounded like people were banging glass on an aluminum plate. \n\nAnd that's exactly what was happening.\n\nI turned the corner to see about a dozen street bartenders, all between 16-25 years old, making drinks on the street.  The beverages are not alcoholic, mostly juices and shakes, but their bartending skills were SO DAMN IMPRESSIVE that I couldn't not share it with you.\n\nIndia is one of the coolest, most vibrant places I've ever been.  I'm completely overwhelmed, in a good way.  Every place I look there is something interesting to see.  Something to smell or eat.

The way that people dress is different.  The cuisine is different.  The buildings are different.   \n\nThey get such little tourism that the people are extremely curious and welcoming.   \n\nPeshawar is my kind of place, and I can't wait to show you more of this city over the coming days :)\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky for daily updates!\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n►TW: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

        "description": "Dear Friends,\n\nI am very excited to announce that I will be making a 90 minute documentary, which will be shot from May-July during my final 6 countries (Palau, Saudi Arabia, Ghana, Ecuador, Venezuela, Jamaica).   \n\nThis is a project that I've been wanting to create for years, and after pitching it around to some top documentary filmmakers, I have teamed up with an awesome guy named Chris Wedding, who is based out of L.A.   Chris is the perfect fit to bring this idea to life.  He and another cinematographer will be traveling with me as I complete this ambitious journey to every country. \n\nThis documentary will NOT be anything like my daily travel videos, nor a compilation of my travels.  You've already seen that through my videos. \n\nInstead, the film will take you behind the scenes of what it's really like to visit every country.  It will be personal.  You will hear from my family and close friends.   It will discuss things that I don't ever tell you, like my severe anxiety.  We will discuss how dedicated I am to work 15 hour days, 7 days a week for 3 straight years to create these videos, which have amassed 1.1 billion views.  We will talk about how social media (video making) has not only allowed me to finance my trips, but has let me connect with amazing locals -- and how I rely on their generosity to introduce me to their homeland.  We will dive deep into this 'every country' culture, as there are only ~200 people who have done it and many more on the way.   And LOTS more! \n\nIf you want to stay up to date on our project, please follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinskydocumentary/\n\nChris will be sharing a lot of BTS on his Instagram as well: www.instagram.com/look_see_do\n\nI will be investing a lot of my time, energy and money into this project throughout 2020, and I couldn't be more excited to share it with you!\n\nTHANK YOU!!\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

        "description": "Constant travel is a lot more unhealthy than you think.  I am the most overweight, unhealthy and lazy I've ever been in my entire life. You might not realize this happening 'behind the scenes' -- but life as a nonstop traveler surely has its downfalls. \n\nThis unhealthy travel lifestyle has come as a result of constant jet lag, changing time zones, climates, cuisines, frequent cases of food poisoning (like right now), a lack of working out, and most of my meals being either airplane food, hotel buffets or street food.\n\nI've tried to start working out countless times, but it's almost impossible because I don't have a consistent routine when I travel.

It's a region that spans Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan - but the majority of the area is completely off limits for tourists to enter. I had the rare opportunity to visit Iranian Balochistan with my local friend Amin, along with his friends Hamzeh and Shaquib. The 4 of us spent 72 hours meeting locals, eating delicious food, and seeing the natural wonders of Baluchistan. And all I can say is that it was FANTASTIC. It's definitely my kind of place and a trip that I will remember for a lifetime.  \n\nAs I get older and visit more places, I can tell you that life is far more interesting the further off the beaten path you go.  Baluchistan is as good as it gets.  Thank you for watching! \n\nIf you want to come to Iran, then DM Amin and he can organize your trip! https://instagram.com/amin.riasati\n\nFollow  @Drew Binsky  for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n► IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY Country in the world (197/197).

Traffic is no fun for anyone -- it's huge time killer and in some places, sitting in traffic is extremely unsafe.  \n\nWhile I strongly consider Dhaka to have the most dangerous traffic roads on earth -- there are many other cities around the world with overly congested and alarming streets. \n\nIn this video, I share with you the 'Top 5 Worst Traffic Cities on Earth' from my own personal experiences. \n\n5. Delhi, India\n4. Bangkok, Thailand\n3. Kampala, Uganda\n2. Manila, Philippines\n1. Dhaka Bangladesh\n\nDo you agree with my list? Which other cities do you think have traffic as bad as the ones I discussed here? Would love to get your thoughts.\n\nAnd to all my friends in Bangladesh, we are still keeping you in our thoughts. I hope this violence nonsense ends soon, and that safer roads/laws will finally be implemented to better your society.\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

A town of complete unity and togetherness, with 3,000+ residents who come from 57 countries around the world.   A cashless society that has no religion, no laws and a 0% crime rate.   A place where anything is possible, and encouraged, with the most laidback lifestyle I've ever seen. \n\nThis is the real life Burning Man... and it's been around since 1968!\n\nHave you ever heard about Auroville? What are your thoughts about it?\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky.  Thank you Michael (IG @affinityadventure) for the shots & edits.  \n\nPS - This video probably won't get the most views, but I had the most fun shooting it and putting this story together.

Chuao was SO unexpected and beautiful... I am still pinching myself if this was a dream or if it was reality.\n\nIn this video, I take you on the journey to discover Chuao -- from the pristine, untouched beaches to the friendly, hospitable locals and the world famous cacao (which is soooo delicious!) This island is a paradise unlike any other I've seen through 194 countries, and I will absolutely be returning back here in the future.\n\nHonestly speaking, Venezuela is NOT as scary as you've heard about on the news - especially when you get outside of Caracas.  Yes, there is a devastating economic crisis and massive hyperinflation, but that doesn't mean that you will get robbed or shot at by walking around on the street.  It doesn't mean that there are no restaurants to eat at or things to do.   Life does exist, somewhat normally, in many parts of the country just like here in Chuao. \n\nIf you're still reading this, I want to say thank you so much for tuning into my videos in Venezuela.  I'm having a lot of fun on this trip and making these stories, and the best are yet to come!\n\nFollow @drewbinsky on YT for more travel stories from every country in the world, and join me on IG Stories for live updates: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nThank you to my friend Emmanuel for showing me around Venezuela!

        "description": "I'm very excited to share with you the story of Kerby of Sketchy Stories. \n He makes a living from doodling with a pen and is one of the most talented artists you will ever see.\n\nHis doodles are so impressive that they've landed him gigs with Nike, Netflix, Warner Bros (among dozens of others).  His coloring books are sold in bookstores across 40+ countries and he is a NYT best selling illustrator.\n\nBut the focus of this story is not about his talent, fame or success.  It's about two things.. HARD WORK and PATIENCE.  Both of these things  led him to do something professionally that he loves.\n\nKerby does not come from a big city -- he comes from a very small town in the Philippines called Oas, which has only 67,000 people.  He did not attend a top University in Manila -- he went to Bicol University out in the provinces.\n\nBut he figured out a way to turn his passion into a career through hard work and patience.  Kerby is not \"lucky\" by any means for his success. \nHe earned it.\n\nIf you feel inspired, then share this story with your friends to spread the message!  Because the truth is that anyone reading this right now CAN turn your passion into a career, and not the other way around.\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky.

Please excuse the fast paced editing and shaky camera -- I was a newbie back then**\n\nRegardless of your views on Israel and Palestine, this video will widen your perspectives.\n\nThe tour that I just had of Jerusalem, by two natives — Yuval (an Israeli Jew) and Samer (a Palestinian Muslim), was life changing to say the least. It's extremely rare to get a duel-narrative tour of Jerusalem, and I learned more than I ever thought I'd know about the history and politics of Israel & Palestine.\n\nFrom hearing their real-life stories of growing up in segregated Jerusalem, which challenges they've faced, and how they connect to certain parts of the city — to witnessing them being friends and colleagues today, treating each other equally and with respect — is very humbling and reassuring, and this experience has restored my faith in humanity.\n\nI know there are more Yuvals and Samers out there, either living in Israel/Palestine or elsewhere in the world, who treat each other equally and respectfully, despite their religion and/or differences. Maybe — just maybe — this video will spark a light that will start a movement towards peace for Israel and Palestine. I sure hope so.\n\nThis video was by far the most challenging one I've made - from the planning stages, to the on-site shooting (i.e. security checkpoints) and especially, the tedious editing process which took me pretty much 2 full days. I am proud of how it turned out, and I truly hope your perspectives have been opened, or you've learned something new by watching this video. \n\nI don't ask you to share my videos often, but I will kindly ask if you enjoyed it, to please share it with your friends and family to help me spread this message of peace.\n\nI welcome your thoughts, opinions and constructive criticism (which I know this will get a lot of)… But I'd like you to think twice about how you say things... If you are going to be an online troll — full of hate and ignorance, and someone who causes further conflict through foolish comments — then please turn your attention elsewhere.  I will only be responding to carefully thought-out comments, reactions and questions in this thread.\n\n#DrewBinsky #Israel #Palestine\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

My buddy Wode Maya and I were invited up here by a local singer, songwriter and all around superstar named Wiyaala, and she was kind enough to show us everything around her beloved hometown.   \n\nWiyaala is on another level of inspiring and sincere -- after coming from humble beginnings, she achieved massive international fame after winning a popular singing contest in Ghana several years ago... and now her songs are played from speakers all over the world.  But aside from her musical talents, Wiyaala has the kindest heart as you will see in this video.  Despite financial success and freedom, she chooses to live here in Funsi with her family and friends.  After traveling to 192 countries, I can say with confidence that the people in this village are the some of the friendliest and most hospitable on this planet -- and this has been an experience that I will never forget.\n\nThank you Wiyaala for hosting us and for being such a blessing to this world.

I am devastated by what is happening and my thoughts and prayers go out to the victims of this war.  If you want to help, my friends @YesTheoryare currently in Poland and have started a GoFundMe to help Ukrainian refugees with food, water, and necessities. They have already raised $500,000, and 100% of proceeds are going directly to help save lives: Donate here: https://bit.ly/3N5jQGJ\n\nOkay, now onto the description of the video... Riding on the Trans-Siberian Train has been a bucket list adventure for me for as long as I can remember (8 years?). The train starts in Moscow and then travels 10,000 kilometers Eastbound across Siberia until it ends in Vladivostok.  I was lucky enough to catch Trans-Siberian train for a 30-hour leg – from Irkutsk to Novosibirsk – and it was one of the wildest travel experiences of my life.  Even in the middle of winter, where temperatures were around -30C, I couldn’t believe how scenic the views were out the window. It felt like a dream! \n\nOn the Trans-Siberian train, I met two incredible characters – Gregory (the train conductor) and Sacha (the drunk passenger) who I shared the entire experience with.  I will never forget this train ride.  It was the journey of a lifetime, and I can’t wait to (hopefully) finish the rest of the adventure someday soon.  Siberia is truly a remarkable place.

        "description": "✅ SUBSCRIBE for more travel videos: https://bit.ly/3iAZlnw\n\nToday, in the Seychelles, has been a complete disaster. Nothing has gone right. And I am very frustrated.\n\nThis morning, I woke up at 5AM ready to explore Mahé island (the main island of the Seychelles), but a rain storm came rolling through which forced me to delay the morning start until 9:30. When I hopped on the bus to the beach, there was a bad car accident in the road, causing another hour delay and everybody freaking out. Finally, I made it to the beach, only to discover everything being closed because it's a National Holiday today in the Seychelles. So I went to the capital town of Victoria, which was more like a ghost town as no restaurants or stores are open. I managed to find a small shop to get snacks, and while I was inside the store, I witnessed a bad street fight happening between two drunk people outside.  That's what I call a disaster in the Seychelles.\n\nDespite being really frustrated and upset, I realized that none of these events have been in my control -- and that's why I should not hate the Seychelles.\n\nThis also is a reminder not hate ANY place based on unexpected events that happen out of your control (bad weather, breaking your arm, public holidays, etc).\n\nSimilar unfortunate events have happened to me in other countries, like Bulgaria, Brunei and India -- and when these situations happen, we need to be mature and move on. It's all part of the travel experience.\n\nWhile 95% of my videos are positive and happy, I think it's important to show you the negative (more realistic) side of travel like my experience in the Seychelles... Because truth be told, for every good experience that happens on the road, something bad happens. I never tell you about all the travel delays, missed flights, and scams that I constantly deal with!\n\nCan anyone out there relate to what I am saying in this video? Please comment with your thoughts and/or share your experiences of unfortunate events that have happened to you while traveling. I'm curious to know!\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

It happened to me when I was en route from Udaipur to Jodhpur in the Rajasthan state.  I was the only foreigner on the bus, and the only English speaker.  The bus crashed around 1AM local time, in the middle of nowhere.  It was the only time that I had to put my hand over my pulse to see if my heart was still beating.  2 people did not make it out alive.   I get anxiety just thinking about what happened. \n\nI do not hate India - I have had some incredible experiences around the country.

In the city of Novosibirsk, I walked into a traditional Russian bathhouse (called a banya), and I was greeted by a giant man named Herman. Herman ordered me to take off all my clothes and enter a 160-degree sauna (70C). I was then beaten by thorny Russian birch trees as well as a thick wooden stick. Then, I went outside to get an ice-cold bucket of water was poured on my head. \n\nThe Russian banya experience took me back to the time when I did a Turkish bath, but this one was more intense! I absolutely love doing these activities - it’s the reason why I love traveling - to experience new cultures and learn about how other people spend their days. And truth be told, I felt very clean and relaxed after this bath — despite the pain that I went through!\n\nLastly, I want to thank you for tuning into the last 5 weeks of stories in Russia/Siberia.  All content was filmed a month before Russia invaded Ukraine, so it comes with a very heavy heart.  I decided to share these videos because I strongly believe that the Russian people are NOT a representation on their crazy, evil dictator.

Have you ever heard of Palau before?  It's one of the most beautiful countries in the world in terms of beaches and nature -- but it's also one of the most expensive because almost everything here needs to be imported.  With that being said, find out how many things I could purchase around the island for $10.  \n\nWatch this video until the end, it takes an emotional turn when I get to Pelileu. The island where my Grandpa Jack fought in WWII and got shot in the leg.  Before he passed away a few months ago, I was able to hear his harrowing Palau battle stories and I traced his footsteps.

There is no right or wrong answer; everyone is entitled to their own opinion about what they think qualifies as a 'country.' \n\nThe topic of 'how many countries are there' is a very complicated and touchy subject (especially when people from almost every country will see this video), but I have done my best to reason why I side with the U.N.'s list of 193 countries. \n\nIt's pretty surreal to think that my goal of visiting every country is now within reach. I have just 54 left! And after this year (if all goes as planned) I will have 37 left. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on how many countries there are in the world?

It was the 12th consecutive year of Ginger Fest, held in a small town in Southern Netherlands called Tilburg.  And what a blast it was!\n\nMore than 1,000 gingers, from all over the globe, came in for a weekend of music, activities, picnics, bar crawls and just old-fashioned FUN.  \n\nBut I must admit.. it was pretty strange to spend 2 days exclusively with other members of the ginger community.  Why?  Because we have nothing else in common other than our unique genetic mutations. Most festivals/gatherings around the world are centered around a common INTEREST, such as music, sports, arts, etc -- but this one?  It's just a bunch of redheads taking over a small Dutch town!  \n\nThat being said, I will say that it was a fun time, and I made several new redhead friends who took me around UTRECHT (my new favorite city in Europe). It's a mini-Amsterdam, without all the tourists - as you'll find out in this story! \n\nThanks for watching and stay tuned for next week, when I visit the bizarre town called BAARLE which is literally stuck in between two countries: Netherlands and Belgium. \n#ginger #redhead #netherlands \n\nFollow @drewbinsky  for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on\n\n👕 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO 🌎: https://shopjustgo.com/\n\n👫 JOIN over 32,000 people in our JUST GO APP!  https://bit.ly/3iAZlnw\n✈️ BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n► IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I have been to EVERY Country in the world (197/197).

I’ve always said that it’s one of the most underrated countries in Europe. The historical sites and monuments are breathtaking. The people are very humble and friendly and I have nothing but incredible memories during my 10 day trip to Ukraine in 2015.\n\nI just spent 3 weeks traveling across Eastern Russia (Siberia) and while I really enjoyed my trip, in terms of culture and adventure — the politics just don’t make sense to me. I just woke up to the news that Russia invaded Ukraine, and I don't understand why anyone wants to start another war.  This is devastating. \n\nMy heart aches for the 44 million people living in Ukraine, many who are currently listening to the sounds of explosions and don’t know what tomorrow will bring. I wish nothing but health and safety for all of my Ukrainians friends out there. We are keeping you in our thoughts and prayers 💔🇺🇦\n\nMy first Russia video goes live on Sunday (two days from now) and then for the next 4 consecutive weeks, you will see episodes from my Russia (Siberia) series.

After a 6 hour journey up to 3,500 meters, we slept overnight at the stunning crater, and admired the world's largest lava lake.  \n\nIt was, without question, one of the best travel days of my life.\n\nBut this story is not so much about the volcano itself.  It's about a guy named Elias, who since 1991, has been a porter and chef to cater for tourists who want to hike to the top.\n\nI was randomly paired up with him, and was so astonished by how he carries up to 55 pounds of things with him up and down this volcano, three times a week.   For the last 29 years.  And he makes roughly $4 a day. \n\nElias deserves every bit of credit for his determination and hard work.

There are more pyramids (200+) in this tiny section of Sudan than in all of Egypt, and they are just as old and impressive!\n\nMy Sudanese friends and I took a camel ride to explore around the area and we were the only ones around.  Not another soul in sight.  \n\nIf you ask me, this experience was about 10X more enjoyable than the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, which is now flooded by tour bus after bus.

It's a tiny Portuguese-speaking island just 200 miles West of Gabon in Central Africa.\n\nThis morning, someone at my guesthouse told me that the Equator runs through the very bottom part of the country, so I decided to go on a wild journey to find it, and document every step of the way.  Have you ever been to the equator?\n\n**NOTE** -- This video style is a completely new approach for me. It's longer, unscripted and there's no voice over. I would really appreciate if you could give me some feedback on it. What did you like and what did you not like ? Should I do these kind of spontaneous \"vlog\" videos more often?

If not, you're in for a real treat (literally, wait until you see how much we ate)! \n\nIn Thailand, some markets are \"floating\" -- meaning they function entirely on narrow canals with small boats moving up and down . You pay a small price to hire a boat driver for an hour (or longer), and then choose which delicious meals to eat from dozens of vendors (on boats) with elderly women cooking up something unique. It's all cheap and delicious and this is debatably the best experience you can have in Thailand. \n\nThis morning, my buddy Mark Wiens from Migrationology and I headed 2 hours outside of Bangkok to a floating market called Damnoen Saduak, where he introduced me to some of Thailand's best dishes. We had a blast shooting this video and I hope you enjoy what we have to share! \n\nAlso -- If you don't already know, Mark makes some of the best food travel videos out there, so check out his page below for more deliciousness. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/migrationology\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

I've asked several people when they were born, and they couldn't give me an answer... because they don't know. \n\nWhy?\n\nThe Bhutanese genuinely believe that leading a happy life is more important than how many years you’ve been alive (birthday). If that doesn't make you smile, then I don't know what will :)\n\nInstead of recognizing individual birthdays – they decided that all citizens turn 1 year older every Jan 1st. So everyone celebrates a birthday on New Year's Day! \n\nWhile this system is more prevalent in the older generation (younger kids living in cities do know their birthdays) -- it's still proves how fascinating this country is. I've never been to a place where people don't know their birthdays, and don't care to know. They just want to life in peace.\n\nThe sun rises everyday. The sun sets everyday. Life happens.

I think they are the world's most interesting people.\n\nThe Himbas 'initiated' me into their tribe, by splatting my face with their red clay, teaching me how to do their traditional dance and plenty more which you will see in this video.  \n\nBy the end of the day, they invited me to sleep in their huts with them, but I respectfully (and regretfully) declined (because I have a 5AM wake up tomorrow morning, and I don't have a big jacket as it gets freezing overnight). \n\nI've made over 400 videos now, and this is my favorite one yet by a long shot.   As you probably know, I love going to far away places, interacting unique groups of people and find ways to connect with them.  It was a completely surreal, out-of-body experience, that I am so excited to share with you.

If not, then you might be surprised by what I'm about to tell you.\n\nIn 2008, a loaf of bread in Zimbabwe would cost you more than a TRILLION Zimbabwean Dollars. This extreme hyperinflation led to the collapse of their currency, which in turn led Zimbabwe into a huge economic crisis.\n\nIn 2009, they adopted the U.S Dollar, which is still the main currency today, but with such high demand for dollars and such a limited supply, the cash in simply running out.\n\nBut don't panic yet, because an innovative solution has been introduced to fix this currency crisis. It's called ECO CASH, and it's a way to make payments by sending a TEXT MESSAGE on ANY functioning mobile device. It basically turns cash into a digital currency (not like Bitcoin or PayPal) -- and you can buy anything with it (from groceries to taxis to street food). No banks or apps are involved... just text messaging. I am shocked how efficient it works.\n\nI met about a dozen Zimbabweans over the last few days, and they all told me that Eco Cash is the only thing holding their economy together until a new currency is created or a new system is put in place..\n\nDo you think Eco Cash would be useful for other countries to adopt? I surely do!\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post more videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \nteam@drewbinsky.com\n\nP.S.

THE TRAFFIC IN MANILA. \n\nManila ranks in my Top 5 worst traffic cities on earth (along with Delhi, Dhaka, Bangkok & Mumbai). It's a nightmare to get around this city, especially during rush hour, when it can take 3+ hours to drive 5 miles. Something needs to be done to fix it. \n\nYou'd think when a city has traffic this bad, there would be an EFFICIENT public transportation system in place (i.e. metro) to get people from point A to point B. But that's not the case in Manila. \n\nThere is a functioning metro (MRT) in Manila, which has been around for 20+ years, but it's miserable to ride. Most other big Asian city that I've been to have enjoyable metros - like Bangkok, Taipei and Hong Kong - but in Manila, it's the opposite of enjoyable. It's overly crowded, beyond dirty, extra noisy and steaming hot. \n\nIn case you were wondering, funding ($$$) is NOT the issue - as the government subsidized several BILLION Pesos to fix the MRT a few years ago by building new stations and 48 new coaches... But thanks to technical difficulties & faulty designs, that project has gone to waste until now.\n\nDoes anyone have any solutions for how to fix the traffic/public transportation issue in Manila? Because if it can be fixed, then this city would be a lot more enjoyable to live in and visit for tourists. \n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post more videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \nteam@drewbinsky.com",

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► Lee's Insta: https://www.instagram.com/leeabbamonte/\n\nThis is the inspiring story of my great friend Lee Abbamonte, who has just flown out from NYC to meet me here in Ethiopia.  We are heading to Somalia, next!\n\nLee is one of the world's most traveled people.  He has been to every U.N. member state, U.S. state, U.S. national park, both the North and South poles, and 321 unique territories overall.  \n\nHe finished all of the countries in 2011, about 9 years before I will do it, and those 9 years made a lot of difference in terms of how we each approached this mission.  In short, Lee wasn't able to leverage social media to lower his travel costs and get paid to travel...  because it wasn't popular back then.  Instead, he had to work and save his own money the old fashioned way -- making the journey significantly more expensive than what it's costing me.    He actually started his travels before the internet took off, back in 1998!\n\nI hope you enjoy hearing Lee's story as he's a great friend and mentor.  We are both about to go on one of the craziest trips of our lives to Mogadishu, Somalia tomorrow -- so stay tuned!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG STORIES for more! https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nLee's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/leeabbamonte/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

It's so potent that a single trip can last up to 7 days. \n\nPatrick drove me an hour outside of Libreville to a tiny village, where we met a lady (who he calls Mama), who is known as the \"Queen of Iboga.\" She hosts people from all over the world to \"initiate them\" in a bizarre ceremony -- which I participated in.\n\nP.S. - If you are wondering, I only ate a small bite to taste it and did not feel any effect... I am not the type of person who would enjoy completely tripping out for days with no control.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nAfter a rough few days in Sierra Leone, we have made it onwards to the next West African country of Guinea (Conakry).\n\nIt's been a wild 2.5 days here so far, from the challenging roads to the (once again) disgusting corruption and bribery that we had to deal with.  But we made it, after 11 LONG hours of driving 150 miles, to the capital of Conakry.\n\nInitially, we had a great time exploring the fish market at sunrise and then getting secret access inside the 2nd biggest mosque in sub Saharan Africa -- but then things quickly turned bad when thousands of policemen (armed with AK47s, helmets and bullet proof vests) stormed the streets in preparation for the riots which have been destroying the city.   \n\nWe quickly ran (literally) back to our hotel and called it a day.  We didn't leave the hotel anytime afterwards.  \n\nThis region of the world is tough to travel across, especially in your own vehicle.  At each of the dozens and dozens of police checkpoints, we are always pulled over to show our car papers/insurance, and even after we do correctly, the corrupt police will find ANY reason to pick on us (often times, making up some random law) until we pay them off.  It makes me sad. \n\nBUT I HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS (in case you missed yesterday's video)!  THE SIERRA LEONE GOVERNMENT SAW MY VIDEO ABOUT US GETTING SCAMMED AND THEY WENT TO THE BORDER TO ARREST THE 3 GUYS AND NOW THEY ARE IN PRISON!  One step closer to making this region a safer place to visit for everyone.\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories to join my Africa trip in real time! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

I'm still on this incredible 3-week road trip around Turkey, and today we unexpectedly found ourselves in an AMAZING city called Diyarbakir -- in the South Eastern part of the country. \n\nWe did not originally plan to come here because of recent events and security issues that (we thought) would be unsafe... BUT it turns out that Diyarbakir is my new favorite place in Turkey!   The culture is so raw and authentic -- it really feels like I've traveled back in time.  Nothing is modernized. Nobody is seen on their smartphones, or in a rush to get somewhere.  Everything is seemingly the same to how you would find it hundreds of years ago, and I really love that! \n\nAnd the best part about Diyarbakir are the medieval city walls that are the longest in the world after the Great Wall of China!

        "description": "Walmart shocks me every time I come back to the states, by much it dominates every other retail store. \n\nIt is the World's largest company by revenue ($480 billion/year) and by far, the biggest store I've ever been inside of. It literally has EVERYTHING and ANYTHING you could ever need at a very cheap price. \n\nIn this video, I take a deeper look at Walmart's success story from its beginning in 1962 in Bentonville, Arkansas by a guy named Sam Walton. \n\nDo you like to shop at Walmart?

The last time I came to Myanmar (5 years ago), I became really good friends with a local tour operator named Sai, who sponsored my trip in exchange for a blog post (back when I used to be a blogger). \n\nThe post I wrote went viral, and gave him a lot of new clients which he was really thankful for.  We remained close friends until I got a devastating email several years ago from a lady (who was on a tour with Sai after reading my blog post).  She told me that Sai got in a car crash and passed away.  He was not wearing a seat belt. \n\nThis memory has haunted me for a long time.  Every time I came across the word \"Myanmar,\" I instantly thought about Sai.  \n\nAnd now I'm back here, and enjoying my trip overall... but I can't help but notice the unsafe situation these streets.  I took 4 taxis over the last few days and all 4 didn't have seat belts in the back seat.  To make matters even more frightening, many drivers on the streets of Yangon are reckless and I was terrified as I sat in the back seat without a seat belt on. \n\nI hope the government of Myanmar sees this video and does something to implement a change.  We've already lost Sai, and I hope that nobody else passes away from something that is easily preventable. \n\nThat's all I want to say.  I do love Myanmar and I will certainly be back again someday, hopefully when I will feel safer getting around town.\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG for more travel stories.  https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

For the most part, women stay  at home to watch their kids, clean the house, prepare food, etc. This is how the culture has been functioning for thousands and thousands of years, especially right here in Afghanistan. \n\nBUT, that doesn't mean that there aren't as many women as men who are doing inspiring things!   In general, women are shy of the camera and they don't want to be exposed for cultural reasons, which is something that I always respect and honor.   This is why I do not show many women in my videos. \n\nHowever, over the last few weeks as I've traveled around Afghanistan, I've been able to sit down with 6 incredible women entrepreneurs to hear their stories.   They all have amazing things to say!! \n\nI really enjoyed making this video and I hope that you guys enjoy listening what they have to say, because as we all know, women make the world go 'round!\n\nFollow @drewbinsky for more stories from every country in the world, and join me on Instagram! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Afghanistan #Women\n\nTEXT ME and I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n\nGet your music on Musicbed!

After then sun goes down -- regardless of which day it is -- neon signs illuminate the busy roads, bars and nightclubs stay crowded until 6AM, and the magnitude of street food vendors and restaurants are serving sizzling Korean BBQ throughout the night.\n\nI'm thrilled to be back here in South Korea -- the country that I moved to straight out of college to teach English for 2 years.   It's nostalgic to be roaming around in my old stomping grounds, and it's going to be fun to show you around this megacity over then coming 5 days.\n\nHave you ever been to Seoul?

This place is made up of 32 small villages, entirely made from mud bricks!  Some of the settlements, like Shibam, are over 600 years old which has awarded them to be a UNESCO World Heritage Site.   Shibam is actually considered as the \"world's first skyscraper city\" and best example of urban planning based on vertical construction.\n\nI felt 100% safe as I wandered around these villages, meeting people and seeing their humble way of living.  I was lucky enough to randomly join a wedding celebration as well!\n\nI bet this isn't what you thought Yemen was like.  For me at least, it sure wasn't.

It's one of the most offensive words that you can say... But in the West African country of Niger, it's just the opposite.  In fact, you are just saying the name of the country!\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\n\nAre you on Instagram?

        "description": "This is one of the strangest stories you will hear in a while -- the Voodoo Grandmas of Hong Kong.\n\nIn Hong Kong, you can go under a random bridge in Causeway Bay -- one of the busiest areas of the city --  to find about a dozen voodoo grandmas over 75 years old.  \n\nThese grandmas are there to help you get rid of evil voodoo spirits from someone that you hate (i.e. an ex-lover or mean boss).  All you have to do is arrive with a photo of their face, and the grandma will beat it down to pieces with a shoe while saying nasty things and then light it on fire.  You have to see it to believe it. \n\nFun fact: I actually did this while filming a pilot for a TV show in Hong Kong in 2015, but unfortunately that never got aired so I am happy to share this story with you today for the first time. \n\nJust curious, do you believe in voodoo stuff like this?

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nYemen is having many problems at the moment, but the most obvious to me so far has been the shortage of gasoline.  We've driven over 14 hours so far from the Oman/Yemen border to the city of Mukalla, and it was a wild experience every time we had to stop at the gas station.\n\nInstead of using normal gas stations (which are mostly out of gas), there are young kids on motorbikes who track you down on the road and offer to fill up your car with \"illegal\" gasoline.  The price has increased 300% over the last few years because of the short supply. \n\nWhat's ironic is that Yemen does sit on an abundance of oil reserves, but unfortunately, they are being taken advantage of by their neighbors and are unable to use much of that gas for themselves.\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for live updates inside Yemen: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n►TW: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \nteam (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

It has THE MOST humble & hospitable people, delicious foods, ancient history and a culture that feels like you've traveled back in time.\n\nAnd should I mention that Iran is one of the world's safest countries? I felt safer traveling in Iran than I do in my own country -- this is not a joke.\n\nAnd just in case you are wondering — nobody told me to make this video. It is not sponsored. I made it out of pure joy because I want to share with you my 100% honest thoughts and feelings towards Iran. I can't wait to visit again soon (hopefully 2019!)\n\nHave you ever been to Iran?

It's more than twice as severe as the U.S. Great Depression, and I simply cannot ignore this sad reality as I am visiting the country...  \n\nThe main driver for this economic crisis is oil. \n\nNearly a century ago, massive oil reserves were discovered off the Northern coast of Venezuela, which is why the country used to be the wealthiest in Latin America (in the 1960s and 1970s)... But sadly, a series of poor decisions, mismanagement and (recent) U.S. sanctions has crippled its economy to pieces.  Nowadays, despite having one of the world's largest oil reserves, there is a HUGE gas shortage and the locals have to wait in their car HOURS or even DAYS just to fill up their gas tank.  It's a very sad reality and I've never seen anything like it before in all of my travels to 194 countries.  My heart is with the people of Venezuela and I sincerely hope that the situation gets better so the country can thrive again like the olden days. \n\nJoin me in this part-documentary, part-adventure vlog as I educate you about the devastating gas crisis in Venezuela.\n\nFollow @drewbinsky for more stories from every country in the world, and join me on Instagram! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Venezuela #Economics\n\nThank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO.

The capital city, Nicosia, is the only capital in the world to be in two continents, and it's bizarre how the culture drastically changes when you step over a border within the same city.\n\nMy goal in making this video is to educate you on the history of Cyprus, as well as share my unbiased opinions as I visit both the Greek & Turkish sides of the island.\n\nPlease refrain from starting a Greek vs. Cyprus political debate. That's not what this video is about. Any rude/nasty comments will be deleted.\n\nThis video was NOT easy to make.. it took me 2 hours just to find a place to say the opening lines... Police on every corner stopped me from taking photos around the walled border. And it was SO hot outside that I almost passed out.. but it was all worth it!!\n\n#DrewBinsky #Cyprus #Europe\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

It's fun being spontaneous sometimes. \n\nI arrived in the capital of Madagascar called Antananarivo early this morning with no hotel reservation, no plan and no idea what I'd be doing... Just seeking adventure!\n\nThrough Facebook, I got in touch with a local girl named Ali, who picked me up at the airport with her 2 classmate friends, Dave and Nancy. Not only have they been AMAZING tour guides around Antananarivo, but Dave volunteered to let me sleep at his house with his family -- who cooked me a delicious dinner of Madagascar food called Vary Amin’anana. Life doesn't get any better than this!\n\nToday is a day that I'll never forget. I am so happy to be back in Africa and so thankful to be able to find people like Ali, Dave & Nancy from social media.

His neighborhood was completely destroyed from bombings.  His parents pushed him to move to the Philippines to start a new life, and although it was difficult at first to immerse into Filipino culture, he has become a successful vlogger and entrepreneur and has a very bright future ahead. \n\nThis is a story of courage.

I hope you will watch to the end so you can learn about the unique lifestyles of the 'Marsh Arabs.'\n\nIraq is famous for their \"Iraqi Marshlands\" (also known as Mesopotamian Marshes).  It's a rare, aquatic landscapes in the desert, stretching hundreds of miles across Southeastern Iraq into Southwestern Iran. \n\nIn fact, these marshes were one of the largest wetland ecosystems in the world until sadly, they were drained in the 1980s and 1990s under a former presidents' rule.  However, in recent years, the marshlands are back to higher water levels and it was awarded as a UNESCO world heritage site in 2016.\n\nI visited the Iraqi Marshlands with my buddy Alvaro for 24 hours, and I documented the entire adventure for you to see.

In his early life, he found out (from his father) that he has Jewish ancestry, so he spent 15 years living between the U.S. and Israel to learn more about his religion.  \n\nTo this day, he remains Orthodox, keeping Shabbat and eating kosher -- which is not as easy as it sounds here in the Philippines, a country that's 85-90% dominated by Catholicism. \n\nOh yeah, and he's also a super famous rockstar from the 1970s, with several big hits around the country like \"Laki sa Layaw.\"  I didn't mention in the video that he opened up for Led Zeppelin in the 1970s in Tokyo, which is my favorite band of all time!  \n\nIf you enjoyed this video, it would mean a lot to me if you shared it with your friends because I spent 3 days putting it together :)\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky for daily travel videos, and I'm also posting daily on Instagram: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n►TW: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

And every single word in the Turkish language can be translated into these unique sounds?\n\nI recently visited Kuskoy and was completely blown away by how cool and unique this vernacular is!   You really have to hear it to believe it. \n\nAs the locals told me, this whistle language was invented around 500 years ago by local farmers, who needed to communicate with their peers over the steep hills...

I've been to over 700 airports around the world, and Angaur Terminal in the Pacific island nation of Palau is by far the SMALLEST!!!  \n\nMy local friend Sachi and I took a propeller plane down to Pelileu, but we decided to take a pit stop in Angaur, only to see this terminal.  It has so much charm and character!  There are no walls, no bathrooms, and no electricity. There's no TSA Pre-Check or security lines.

If you haven't heard of her already, I know you will find her story extremely inspiring! \n\nHalima was born in a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya, because her family was forced to to flee Somalia due to the civil war in the early 1990s.  When she was 7 years old, her family migrated to the USA (Minnesota) where she found herself in a culture shock and couldn't speak English... But that never stopped her from finding her voice! \n\nFast forward 11 years and not only did she become a semi-finalist at Miss Minnesota USA, but she was the FIRST PERSON in their 65 year history to wear a hijab and burkini on stage.  It wasn't intentional, it was just Halima staying true to herself and her beliefs -- but it essentially got the attention of the world and now she has been on the cover of Vogue Magazine, Allure, highlighted in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition among dozens of others.  She travels all over the world doing photoshoots, being a UNICEF ambassador and collaborating with brands that she loves.   And the craziest part? She is only 22 years old! \n\n\nThe sky is the limit for Halima as she continues to be a leader and role model for people in her community, and I can't wait to see what's next!\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more inspiring stories like this one! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#HalimaAden #Somalia #Beauty\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

There are many unknowns right now, but if one thing's for sure, it's that human beings are resilient.  We will get through this together -- how long it takes is up to our cooperation.    \n\nI will admit that my stance on COVID-19 has changed.  From the beginning of the breakout (January), I have been on the road traveling.  While it hasn't disrupted my travel plans, I have now realized the seriousness of this pandemic and we need to take it seriously.   Luckily, I am home with my family and friends now in Arizona, and I will not be moving for (at least) several weeks. \n\nI would love nothing more than to hear your opinions on coronavirus -- how has your life changed?

        "description": "The vast majority of the world has a drinking age limit of 18 or younger. In these countries, drinking alcohol is not considered a 'big deal.' It's a part of life. Kids grow up around liquor at a younger age and don't make it such a big deal to get wasted every weekend. \n\nBut in the USA, the drinking age limit is 21 and it's strictly enforced. In fact, it's the most strictly enforced I've seen out of ANY country in the world. We make drinking a huge deal, and therefore, teenagers have to sneak it in which can be problematic. \n\nI just cannot understand how AMERICANS at 18 YEARS OLD can LEGALLY vote, marry, gamble, serve in the military, buy cigarettes, marijuana -- but not a beer? Something is not right here, and I think the age limit should be lowered to 18. \n\nDo you agree or disagree with me?

It's honestly hard to believe until you see it with your own eyes!\n\nThe most popular drink, by a long shot, is called SOJU and it comes it these green glass bottles, which you'll see in every restaurant/bar in Korea.  Soju is a rice-based liquor and only half as strong as vodka, but don't let that fool you because it will make you very drunk.  Last year, almost 4 billion bottles of soju were sold, making it the world's #1 selling liquor by volume.\n\nHave you ever tried soju before in Korea? Do you like it?\n\nJoin me on Instagram @drewbinsky.   Special thanks to @MichaelMakesFilms for the help, and to @GSMGlobalSeoulMates for hosting us!

        "description": "The way people fall in love in India is not common in the Western World.    It's marriage at first sight!\n\nMost weddings in India are 'arranged marriages,' where a marriage broker matches you with someone who meets your qualifications and social status (age, religion, etc).  In a sense, marriage brokers in India function the same way as Tinder does in the West.\n\nThen, the person seeking love proceeds to go on several dates (5-10 minutes) until they find 'the one.'   Once both parties agree that they want to spend the rest of their lives together, they decide to get married on the spot.   The next time they meet is usually on their wedding day, where hundreds (or thousands) of friends and family members celebrate.\n\nIf anyone reading this had an arranged marriage, please share your story below because it'll be interesting to hear more success stories!\n\nFollow Drew Binsky for daily travel videos.

Please excuse the fast paced editing and shaky camera -- I was a newbie back then**\n\nYou've never experienced 7-Eleven until you've been to Japan... Seriously, they put the \"convenience\" in convenience store and it will blow your mind what you can find inside. \n\n7-Eleven, which is actually co-owned by the Japanese, has MUCH more than just snacks, drinks and slurpees (in fact, slurpees don't even exist here!) 7-Eleven in Japan is almost like a mini Walmart -- a one-stop-shop for anything you could possibly need on the go. And believe it or not, 7-Eleven is Japan's #1 food product retailer, with a large assortment of fresh and tasty meals!!\n\nIn this video, I explore the ins and outs of 7-Eleven in Japan, and why I think it's so amazing. Does anyone else agree with me?

Seven thousand United States dollars ($7,000 USD). I'm so full of emotions right now (excited, nervous, happy, anxious) that I'm not sure how to react...\n\nThe $7,000 was spent on flights to less-touristy countries in Central and West Africa which I will be visiting by myself in Sept/Oct: Namibia, Angola, São Tomé and Príncipe, Gabon, Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Mali and Mauritania.\n\nThe most nerve-racking part about all of this is that I need to have these flight confirmations to start applying for 4 visas right now (Angola, Cameroon, Chad & Mali) -- and if any of those 4 African visas get denied, then I will have to cancel a portion of the trip and I will not get reimbursed for the flight costs. High risk, high reward!\n\nIn case you are wondering, I made this video for a few reasons:\n\nA) I like to be honest & transparent with you in all my videos, and budgeting is very important for any traveler\n\nB) I think it's often overlooked how expensive traveling to Africa is, so I want to tell you (again) the reality of traveling on this continent. Sure, you CAN do it on the cheaper side, but I don't have the time to go overland or the energy to sleep in dirty hostels. I also need access to (the best) wifi everyday so I can work and upload videos!\n\nTruth be told, I am really excited for this trip and to witness the hidden cultures in these African countries first-hand.

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia is a LOT different than I remembered it back in 2014 (when I was here as budget backpacker...) It's bizarre to see how much a city can evolve in just 4 years.\n\nAnyways, the thing I love most about this fascinating country of Malaysia (along with the food) is the extreme DIVERSITY of its citizens. Just walk down any street in K.L., and you'll see all different faces in every different color, with each person uniquely identifying themselves as Malaysian. I say \"uniquely\" because no two people in this country have the same blood - it's all mixed (mostly with some combination of ethnic Malay, Chinese, and/or Indian!)\n\nThis video will explain a little bit more about Malaysia’s spectacular diversity. \n\nStay tuned over the next 3 days as I rediscover Kuala Lumpur's lifestyle, sites, cuisine and people -- I can't wait to show you what's next! And THANK YOU to everyone who came to my meet up.

Lines and lines of cars in the parking lot full of hungry people, and the waiters run full speed with tacos in their hands.  The most popular tacos here are made from cow head, tongue and armpit and it's about $0.50 per taco. \n\nThis restaurant was quite the local experience and the service is efficient as it gets.

She is also the first transgender to represent a huge global brand that caters only towards women.\n\nI met up with Kevin today to learn more about her inspiring story. Follow her on Instagram @KevinBalot to stay updated with her journey. Also, her Youtube is linked below:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/thegirlnamedkevin/\n\nQUESTION: How is the LGBT progress in your country?

He is a popular Instagrammer from Spain who is also on a mission to visit every country in the world (currently he's at 177/197).  We've actually known each other for 4 years online, and this is the first time we've met in real life!\n\nWhat's interesting about Alvaro is not only the fact that he's visiting every country (there are hundreds of people doing it as we speak) -- but it's that he plans to return to a 9-5 job in the corporate world.   In today's society, everyone wants to be \"famous\" and be an \"influencer\" -- and while Alvaro has that fame now, he doesn't see it being sufficient for long term.\n\nAll things considered, he is still planning to travel and post amazing photos (and you should all follow him @Wanderreds) -- and he's an awesome dude.

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nToday I have the pleasure of introducing you to Bashir Osman, who in my opinion, is THE man of Mogadishu.  He is the owner of the hotel I am staying at, called Peace Hotel, and the reason why I find his story to be so inspiring is because he has never left his home to live elsewhere. \n\nAs you probably already know, Mogadishu has been in a constant state of civil war since 1991, and many Somalis have left for a safer life abroad. But not Bashir.  He has toughed out the most dangerous days in Mogadishu, and is very optimistic what the future brings to his city. \n\nThis is my last video in Mogadishu, and I would like to say on a personal note that this has been an incredible trip and I will certainly be coming back here very soon.  The people that I've met over the last 4 days -- every single one of them -- was so friendly and welcoming to me and I have nothing but good things to say in the future.

As soon as he found out that I was coming to visit his country, he reached out on Instagram and offered to show me around, alongside his brother Gustavo. \n\nI didn't know much about Esteban before we met, but after spending 12 days getting to know him across Ecuador, I learned that he is one of the strongest and most optimistic souls that I've ever met. \n\nSeveral years ago, his friend threw him out of a moving car and he lost 1/3rd of his skull.  Doctors weren't sure if he would make it.  He had to completely relearn how to speak Spanish and English from scratch.  \n\nBut through perseverance and positive thinking, Esteban has gotten back on his feet and is now living a normal life.

I am beyond shocked -- as I had no idea it was this clean and safe until coming here!!\n\nFor a brief history lesson - Back in 1994, Rwanda suffered one of the bloodiest genocides in modern history. Within 100 days (April 7 - mid July), roughly 20% of the population, or 1 million people, were slaughtered due to tribal conflicts of land ownership. It was devastating, and feels realistic to me when I learn about it because it happened within my lifetime.\n\nFast forward 24 years, and the capital of Kigali has done a remarkable job reconstructing and rebuilding itself to be a leading African city in terms of modernity, safety, cleanliness and tech (the wifi here is the strongest I've seen on the continent!)\n\nThe streets are so clean here in Rwanda that I could eat off them... I'm being serious! I am having flashbacks to walking around Singapore - especially when I went to a swanky rooftop infinity pool over looking the city (reminds me exactly of the Marina Bay Sands).\n\nHave you ever been to Kigali?

When I buy a tiny orange juice from a street vendor (which I drink in under 5 seconds) -- I am given a plastic straw (in a plastic wrapper) and a plastic bag. FOR A FREAKING ORANGE JUICE! \n\nAdmittedly, I never took action against single-use plastic until I came to Thailand and saw how bad the problem has gotten. But it’s time to change my habits. \n\nToo much is too much, and the problem needs to stop (not only here in Bangkok, but the rest of the world). Because the more plastic that gets used, the more plastic ending up in our oceans, the more fish that eat plastic, the more plastic that humans eat (because we eat those fish). \n\nThe road to a cleaner, greener earth starts with you and me, so let's pledge to cut back on single-use plastic right now (grocery bags, water bottles, straws, etc).

I'm here for a long layover -- visiting friends, and applying for a 6-month multiple entry visa to Thailand (fingers crossed I get it!)\n\nAnyways, L.A. is the second biggest city in the U.S. and it represents the entire West Coast. Whenever I'm here, I cannot help but compare it to America's biggest city, New York, which represents the East Coast. \n\nWhile both LA & NYC are big, cosmopolitan and diverse -- they are different in just about every way possible.

He is currently teaching English in Yangzhou, China. \n\nOn January 19th, he had a trip scheduled to Bali for vacation, and as soon as he departed China, the coronavirus outbreak had just been announced.   On the exact same day.  \n\nSo for the last 6 weeks ago, Jake has not been able to return home to his apartment where he has all of his belongings.  His teaching job is currently on hold, and will likely be cancelled overall, while his school is paying him a measly $30/day.  And for now, amid all of this uncertainty, Jake is traveling the world -- which I applaud him for doing so!\n\nThis video explains Jake's full story.  I will be sharing my thoughts and opinions on the coronavirus outbreak, how it's impacting travel, and what precautions you should take (etc) in a video very soon -- but for now, I'd love to get your thoughts on this giant mess.

Here in Bangkok, you can't turn a corner without seeing a giant bilboard with a white face smiling back at you.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Asians craze for whiteness? Do you think it's a good thing for their society? Or perhaps long-term side effects may come as a result from taking whitening products?

Plain and simple -- I am frugal.\n\nEven if I made $10M a year, I'd still eat street food, sleep in budget hotels, book the cheapest flights and take the metro over a taxi. I don't ever see the need to spend crazy amounts of money on a fancy car or a giant house.  I am frugal.\n\nBut please note that being \"FRUGAL\" is not the same as being \"CHEAP.\" Frugal means that I choose to prioritize my spending so I can have more of the things i love — like travel and golf. Cheap simply means that I'd be is afraid to spend money on anything, thinking everything is overpriced.\n\nSo as a frugal person, I will always tip generously if the service is good and I will happily spend a few extra dollars if it means I’ll be saving time. \n\nLike Warren Buffett -- the 3rd richest man in the world and someone I look up to -- I plan to give away a significant amount of my future income to charities and/or organizations who could benefit from it more than me. \n\nDoes anyone else choose to live a frugal life?

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nA story about the Yazidis and the genocide of Yazidism by ISIS.\n\nThis is a very sad story, but one that I feel needs to be told because of the lack of international attention that the Yazidi people have received.\n\nIn short, the Yazidis -- who are both an ethnic group and religion -- were targeted and attacked by ISIS in 2014.  On August 3rd of that year, ISIS stormed in one of their beloved towns called Shingal, killing men by the thousands and forcing women into sexual slavery.   And those women who didn't follow their rules (including converting to Islam) were killed.\n\nToday I went to the tiny mountainous village in North Eastern Iraq called Lalish -- which is the site of the holiest temple in Yazidism.  Is it their \"Mecca\" equivalent. In Lalish, it is forbidden to wear shoes to acknowledge the purity of their religion.  \n\nI met some people who survived the genocide and I asked them a few questions.  This is what they have to say.\n\nThis content is not my favorite to make. It's difficult.  It's raw.  It's depressing.  But once again, I feel like it is extremely important to raise awareness -- especially in this case, as it just happened 5 years ago.\n\nJoin me on Instagram @drewbinsky.\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n►TW: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

The last 48 hours here in PNG have been nothing short of incredible.

I was able to live very comfortably.\n\nDuring my 1.5 years teaching English in Korea, I visited 18 new Asian countries, partied every weekend, and ate Korean BBQ 3 nights a week and STILL had money left over to save.

Not only did he pick me up at the airport, give me a room in his house to crash at and take me all over his town of Libreville, Gabon — but he wouldn’t let me spend a dime. \n\nI tried and tried and tried to pay for food, gas, etc, but he wouldn’t let me. What did he expect in return? Absolutely nothing.\n\nIt’s people like Patrick who make me really appreciate the people all over the world.

Not only did he protect his fellow citizens, but he also learned about the importance to protect our mother earth.  \n\nWest Africa, much like other regions of the world (I'm looking at you, South East Asia) have a horrible problem of overconsumption of single-use plastic.  Thanks to people like Modou, we can educate the local population about the issues that plastic brings, and force them to alter their lifestyles.   \n\nShare this to help spread the word!\n\nFollow @Drew Binsky on Instagram for more stories! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n  \n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Men are seen in the office , in the government chairs and walking around the streets. \n\nGender equality is essential for a country to develop both economically and socially -- and thankfully for Pakistan, it's starting to change.\n\nIn recent years, there's been a huge uplift in women's empowerment and women's role in Pakistani society.   More women are being employed at higher jobs positions, more women are voting in the elections and more women are getting their voices heard.\n\nSince I've arrived in Pakistan, I made it a mission to find and interview Pakistani women who are doing inspiring things and changing the game.  Here are 5 of them that I've met so far, who are carving the path for hundreds of millions of women in this country.\n\nI'm on Instagram, too! @drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n►TW: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

Then, try to imagine all the trading and sporting events (i.e. polo) that unfolded here 400+ years ago!\n\nJoin me as I explore the ins and outs of Isfahan, and prove that it really does live up to its title of \"half the world.\"\n\nIf you are planning a trip to Iran and only have one place to visit -- I would highly recommend Isfahan!

I've had the time of my life traveling through this country and I hope you've enjoyed my stories here over the last 9 weeks. \n\nOn my final day in Iraq, I met up with my long time Iraqi friend, Baderkhan, who you might know well from the many videos we shot together in Iraqi Kurdistan.  We hit the streets of Baghdad (his hometown), and tried all of the best street food that the city has to offer!  We were able to eat 5 dishes for just $15USD total, now that's a bargain!\n\nLittle did we know how scary this video would be to shoot -- I left my passport in my hotel room (which is a BIG no-no in Iraq), so we tried to dodge the police the entire day.  If you can remember last week, I was thrown into a police station in the marshlands for using my GoPro... Find out if we made it to the end without any police encounters!\n\nAlso - it's with a heavy heart to explain that 24 hours after we shot this video, there was massive attack in the exact same market, on the exact same street, during the exact same time of the day.  I was devastated to hear the news, and I couldn't believe our luck - we escaped it by just 24 hours.   My deepest condolences go out to all of the loved ones that were lost in this horrible act, and I hope the city will return back to its glory days.\n\nThanks again for watching my videos and I look forward to sharing my next stories in Dubai and Mauritania!\n\nFollow @drewbinsky for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on Insta! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky  \n\n#DrewBinsky #Baghdad #StreetFood\n\n🌍 MY ULTIMATE TRAVEL HACKING COURSE just went live and you can get 50% off if you use the discount code \"YOUTUBE!\" (this offer is only valid for the next 48 hours).  https://www.drewbinsky.com/course\nI made this course so you can become a better traveler and save money -- it has all of my best travel tips, secrets and resources that I've learned from visiting 194 countries.  \n\n👕 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO 🌎: https://shopjustgo.com/\n\n📱 TEXT ME, I will respond! +1 310 349 3854\n✈️ BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n👫 JOIN over 65,000 people in my FB travel community!  https://bit.ly/3uomRZb\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n► IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

This East African nation is overshadowed in many ways by its neighbors of Rwanda, Tanzania, DRC and Uganda -- but there is SO MUCH life happening on these streets, nothing more impressive than their insane drumming skills!\n\nToday, I drove 3 hours from the capital of Bujumbura to a small village called Gishora to witness the drumming culture where it all started.  In fact, they claim to have invented the drum here way back in the day (made of wood and cow skin), and they are expert drummers to this day.  It's a full production of dancing, singing and ... carrying drums on their heads?  It's much harder than it looks! \n\nHere is the full story, which I hope you enjoy -- I stayed up all night editing this one cuz I am so excited to share :)  \n\nThis is Africa at it's finest. \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG STORIES for behind the scenes content  from my trip! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

It feels surreal to be able to say the sentence, “I have been to every single country in the world!” There will be many incredible stories being made these next 2 weeks as I travel across Saudi Arabia. \n\nBut let’s not forget about Palau! This is my last video from this beautiful Pacific-island nation, and it’s one of my favorites!  Palau has a population of less than 18,000 residents. For comparison, my University (Wisconsin-Madison) was two times larger than that! \n\nI challenged myself to see if I could throw the biggest meet-up/party that this country has ever seen. In order to do that, I had to get permission from the Palau’s Visitors Authority as well as the President himself.  \n\nLet’s just say that it was one of the most fun events I’ve ever thrown!!!  I hope you enjoy this story, and thanks for watching my Palau series.  It’s one of the most beautiful countries in the world and I can’t wait to go back! \n\nFollow  @drewbinsky  for more stories from EVERY country, and join me on https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n👕 Thank you for making these travel videos possible by supporting my clothing brand, JUST GO 🌎: https://shopjustgo.com/\n\n✈️ BOOK your next trip here: https://travel.drewbinsky.com/\n👫 JOIN over 65,000 people in my FB travel community!  https://bit.ly/3uomRZb\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n► IG: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n► FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ \n► Tik Tok: https://www.tiktok.com/@drewbinsky\n\n👨🏻‍🦰 WHO AM I? \nI'm Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

I am conversational in Spanish and Korean, semi-conversational in Czech and Russian, and I know many words/phrases in Tagalog, Hebrew, Vietnamese and Thai. \n\nLearning languages is one of the most rewarding parts about travel. It allows me to experience a culture through a new lens, and gives me a deeper understanding of the people's lives and what's happening around me. When I was recently in Equatorial Guinea, I spent a few minutes talking to the owner of a restaurant in Spanish -- and then, I already felt comfortable with my surroundings!\n\nBefore I visit any new country, I always try to learn a few basic words (i.e. yes, no, please, thank you, one, two, three) -- and in many countries, I try to learn a bit more. \n\nI had a lot of fun making this video last year over 2 months in 15 different countries -- THANK YOU to all my friends who helped translate these sentences for me in their respective languages.

You must tip all bartenders, tour guides, restaurants waiters/waitresses, and anyone else in the service industry.   \n\nThe rest of the world, with the exception of a few countries, doesn't have much of a tipping culture.  In some countries (i.e. Japan), tipping is considered rude and will confuse the waiter/waitress!\n\nEvery time I come back home to the States after a long trip abroad (like I am now), I get frustrating with tipping.  I never know how much to give or how little to give.   \n\nWhy is it the customer's choice to decide the salary of the worker?   In my eyes, it makes a lot more sense to pay the service worker a higher salary so tipping is optional.  \n\nWhat are your viewpoints on America's tipping culture?

I just caught up with her on Zoom this morning and here is our conversation!  \n\nLong story short, Fatima was on a 11 day cruise to Antarctica when the Covid-19 outbreak began.  When she departed Ushuaia, Argentina (March 9th) things were quite normal... then she lost phone signal for 7 days as she enjoyed the beautiful wonders of Antarctica, but when she finally got internet, the world was not the same. \n\nThe Argentinian government would not let them dock back in Argentina, so they were forced to go to Montevideo, Uruguay and get on an immediate flight to Los Angeles because the Kuwait airport was closed. \n\nThen you won't believe what her journey was like to fly back home (a few weeks ago) during the heat of the pandemic. \n\nThank you Fatima for sharing your courageous story, and I am so glad that you're safe at home!

I first stumbled upon this food court when I visited with friends in 2015, and I've been a regular customer here since moving to Bangkok last month! \n\nLong story short, I am addicted to this food court called Terminal 21 in Bangkok, so I decided to make a video about it and show you how amazing it is.\n\nSo please, join me in finding out how much delicious Thai food I got here for less than $8USD (total)!

(**Note, this video is 2 weeks delayed**)\n\nTo be honest with you, the more I travel in Islamic countries and surround myself with Muslim people, the more amazed I am by how humble and hospitable they are. \n\nSimilar situations have happened to me in Oman, Tajikistan, Kuwait, Morocco, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE and Jordan (to name a few). I openly tell people in these countries that I am Jewish, and I've never had a single person discriminate against me for my religion. \n\nRamadan is the month-long Islamic holiday where billions of Muslims around the world fast from sunrise to sunset every day. It has been a pleasant surprise to learn about this holy month of Ramadan, which is about to end this weekend, so I wanted to make this video to give you an inside look of how I've discovered Ramadan.\n\nGoing back to the religion thing -- there is a big misconception that being \"Jewish\" is unsafe for traveling around the Middle East or Arabic/Islamic countries. I don't know why people think this way, because from my experiences of telling people I am Jewish, the opposite happens -- they become more curious and want to get to know me! \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

My flight was delayed by 4 hours, so I had to cancel my initial meeting with Mr. President.  And then it almost didn’t happen the next day because his schedule was so hectic...\n\nSo, in between the anxiety of planning the meeting, I rented a car and explored all over this stunning tropical nation.

I am not joking!!\n\nOver the next 14 days, I will be launching daily videos as they happened over the past 2 weeks of my life in this beautiful country. I will be digging deep into the ancient history, trying all of the best dishes, meeting eye to eye with locals and observing their unique lifestyle as I take you behind the scenes of this special nation.\n\nOut of all 14 videos that you are about to see in my Iran series, this one has the strongest message — which is why I am sharing it first. \n\nI truly hope you enjoy watching my raw perspectives around Iran, and I encourage you (as always) to comment below with any questions about Iran and and I’ll do my best to get back to you! \n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nToday, I'd like to take you behind the scenes of my daily life as a video creator.  \n\nLong story short, IT'S A LOT MORE WORK THAN YOU THINK.\n\nIt takes me roughly 15 hours to make each 3-4 minute video that you see pop up on your newsfeed every day (idea creation, scripting, scouting locations, meeting locals, shooting, editing, uploading)...\n\nI work 7 days a week, 365 days a year -- even on holidays, days when I'm flying over an ocean (like today) and when I am sick.  I guess you can call it an addition, and I am not planning to stop making daily travel videos until I step foot in my 197th country (hopefully in January 2020!).\n\nIf you are also a video maker, then you will feel me on constant struggles and pressure that we go through to deliver compelling stories.   It's not easy, and it does take a certain person who is able (and willing) to push themselves mentally and physically on a daily basis.    \n\nAnd while it may seem like I am complaining -- that is not the case.  I love my job and I cannot imagine doing anything else!  I have found my niche, my voice, and my happiness with showing you all the world through my lens!\n\nIf you are reading this right now, I want to say thank you for joining me on this wild adventure.

        "description": "Hi Guys! I have a really exciting video to share with you today.  Meet the traveling Goy's (AKA the Wonderlusters) -- I bumped into them this morning at a temple in Sri Lanka, and after speaking with them for a bit, I decided to make this spontaneous video of their inspiring journey. \n\nLong story short, this family of 4 sold everything back home (Quebec, Canada) to go on a 15 MONTH trip to 50 COUNTRIES for LESS THAN $70,000 USD TOTAL. \n\nI caught them half way on their journey, and I was very impressed to hear about their adventures. I know how tedious it is to plan long trips (as a solo traveler), and I could not imagine doing it for 4 people... not to mention, the patience they have to constantly watch over a 9 and 7 year old!\n\nThe Goy's use all sorts of travel hacks to minimize their expenses (i.e. 16 credit cards to collect points) and they homeschool their youngsters on the road.   If you ask me, no kids on this planet are getting a better education right now than Mateo and Luka, as they experience first-hand the wonders of the world.\n\nShare this video if you feel inspired (and if you wish your parents would have taken you to 50 countries before you turned 10)!\n\nFollow @drewbinsky on Insta for daily travel stories.

With a burning passion. This is something that I haven't discussed much, but I feel very passionate about. \n\nIn my eyes, politics = negativity, turmoil & greed. Nearly all politicians in this world are obsessed with 2 things: money and power, and I've witnessed and/or heard stories about this happening in each of the 140 countries I have visited.\n\nSure, politics is important for putting necessary laws in place, for assuring people can live safely in their country and for understanding how the world works... But I don't understand why it always has to revolve around negativity when there is SO MUCH MORE POSITIVITY happening around us!\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is that I am a very positive and optimistic person, and politics is exactly the opposite -- so I choose not to involve myself in politics in any way, shape or form.\n\nI'd love to get your thoughts and opinions about this - do you also remove yourself from politics?

        "description": "In most of Asia, especially here in South Asia, the societies are heavily driven by men... It's not very common to see a majority of women working on their job, or even walking outside on the streets. \n\nBut that's not the situation here, in Sri Lanka.  This country is ruled by women -- and it has been remarkable to witness.  \n\nEverywhere I look, I am seeing countless women in the workforce -- at both white and blue collar jobs -- contributing to society as they should be.\n\nIt's amazing to see how the Sri Lankan government is rural women to get involved with entrepreneurship.  There's a popular restaurant chain all over this country called Hela Bojun, where women (and only women) are given a place to cook and sell their tastiest local dishes.   \n\nAnd then you have Sthree, initiated by the Women’s Development Center, which empowers women through the eco friendly production of clothes and hand crafts, among several other innovations.  \n\nWomen's equality is just one of the many reasons to love Sri Lanka, and I can't wait to tell you more tomorrow!\n\nFollow my trips on Instagram @drewbinsky - I am posting lots of content there too!\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

        "description": "Did you know that 1.5 MILLION Syrian refugees have settled in Lebanon since 2011? That's equivalent to 125 million refugees flooding into the United States over the last 7 years.\n\nSyria's civil war has resulted in a horrible situation for its innocent people, but it's remarkable to see how Lebanon has opened their arms beyond their means to host these refugees.\n\nToday, my friend Georgio and I contacted an NGO (The Humanitarian Foundation for Social Welfare & Education), who escorted us to a refugee camp with about 100 families living inside. I sat down with several families to hear their life stories and see how they have been impacted by the war.\n\nI was so nervous before going in because I had never interacted with a Syrian or a refugee before, but I quickly found my comfort zone when I realized they are all people like you and me. They were all so friendly -- insisting that we stay in their houses longer for tea and coffee and enjoying our time spent together.\n\nIt was a very touching and emotional day for me, and I sincerely hope that these Syrian refugees get to return home soon.\n\nIf you'd like to donate for the Syrian refugee's food, health and life (anything will help) -- please do so on the following link 🇸🇾❤️🇱🇧  https://bit.ly/2NqayoY.

Then the Spanish came along and discovered silver in the early 16th Century, and they started commercial mining in the area and built an amazing church in 1758 which still stands today.  Even though mining has stopped in the region, the town of Taxco has remarkably carried on its silver tradition.

And now, I've realized that many of them came to Czechoslovakia during the communism period to work or study, and then when communism fell in the early 90s, they never left.\n\nHere is the full story of the Vietnamese influence of Prague, which I find to be fascinating and incredible.\n\nThanks for the shots Michael Makes Films.

Connect w/ travelers for free: https://apple.co/3vYPr75 \n✅ SUBSCRIBE for more travel videos: https://bit.ly/3iAZlnw\n\nToday, I walked into a random dentist office in Bangkok, without an appointment or health insurance, paid $18 USD (600 Baht) and immediately saw a fantastic dentist, who gave me a deep teeth cleaning for an hour. Completely spotless. \n\nBack home, if I want to see a dentist for the same general teeth cleaning, I must make an appointment 3 months in advance AND pay 6X the price that I just paid in Thailand. For the exact same teeth cleaning!\n\nThe topic of this video goes beyond dental work -- it's health care in general. Thailand has one of the best overall health care systems in Asia (highly skilled doctors, incredibly modern hospital facilities, technologies, etc) -- and it's very cheap. Especially if you need to get any medications (prescription or over-the-counter), it's maybe 10X cheaper than back home. \n\nMany of you are going to bring politics into this video, but I am steering clear of that. I am only making this to introduce you to the world of health care in Thailand because many of you may not realize! \n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

Please excuse the fast paced editing and shaky camera -- I was a newbie back then**\n\nHELLO FROM THE SOUTHERN END OF THE WORLD -- Cape Horn, Chile!\n\nCape Horn is the second-to-last stop on our Hurtigruten Expedition (I really don't want this trip to end!). It's the Southernmost point in South America, and the place where the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans meet.\n\nCape Horn is widely considered to have the most dangerous seas for sailors to cross, as thousands of lives have been taken since it was first discovered in 1616 by Dutch explorers. The hazardous year-round weather produces strong ocean currents, gale force winds and massive waves... Not to mention, the remoteness of these islands, far away from any civilization, make it very difficult to escape or call for help in an emergency situation.\n\nMost attempted landings to Cape Horn have failed because of the wind & rain, but today we got EXTREMELY lucky with sunshine and moderate winds. I was told that this day is 1 in 100 by some of our crew members who have been to Cape Horn dozens of times.\n\nHave you ever heard about Cape Horn? It's a great place to add to your bucket list! Also Chile is awesome!\n\nMusic: Kevin MacLeod\n\n#Chile #DrewBinsky #Travel\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

I was supposed to be in Palau in this very moment.\n\nWell, clearly, that isn't happening... yet.  I'm stuck right now in L.A. and I have no idea when I'll be on the road again.

Without you guys, I would probably be working a 9-5 somewhere and even more depressed with life at the moment.  \n\nWe will get through this mess.  It will end.  Life, as we knew it, will return.

Please excuse the fast paced editing and shaky camera -- I was a newbie back then**\n\nIT'S ALL SMILES HERE FROM AMMAN, JORDAN 🇯🇴 \n\nToday was fantastic. We toured all around Amman -- visited ruins and museums, learned about the ancient history, ate lots of hummus and falafel, and I hosted a meet up with lots of likeminded travelers!  There is no doubt in my mind that this is the safest city in the Middle East.  Heck, it's safer than anywhere I've been in the USA!\n\nAlso, I literally haven't slept a wink in 35 hours since leaving Manila and spending all last night editing videos in the Dubai airport... I'M COMPLETELY DEAD. Especially after editing this video. My brain hurts. Going to sleep now, and gotta wake up at 6AM to visit Petra!\n\nHas anyone else been to Amman, Jordan, and can back me up on the fact that it's extremely safe?  I want to hear from you in the comments below!\n\nP.S. - I love the Middle East ❤️ Every time I come here, I am overwhelmed by how welcoming and friendly the people are.

We turn on local news instead of world news. We think the American dream is the only dream. We travel domestically and are scared to go abroad. \n\nThe truth is, that I am constantly meeting smart, innovate and successful people EVERYWHERE I go -- even in the smallest of countries. \n\nWhat are your thoughts on this?

The last 4 days here have been absolutely perfect!\n\nSantiago often gets overlooked by other South American cities like Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and even Lima -- but don't let that fool you, because Santiago truly has it all, and it surely caught me by surprise.\n\nChile, as a whole, is the longest country in the world (4,300 km) from North to South, and it has a lot to offer (especially for all you nature lovers). From the Atacama desert in the North, to the fjords in the South and the spectacular landscapes of Patagonia in between.\n\nAlso, did you know that Chile has the most stable economy and government in all of Latin America? I could certainly notice this by the hustle and bustle on the streets, where so many people here have small businesses and are hustling to make an extra buck (as opposed to begging or making money in illegal ways). Pretty impressive stuff, if you ask me.\n\nI'm looking forward to exploring more of Chile over the coming days (heading to Valparaíso tomorrow!)\n\nWhat's your favorite city in South America? Let me know - I am curious what you all think!\n\n#DrewBinsky #Chile #Santiago\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

I am so impressed by what I experienced today in Syria!  \n\nWelcome to the Krak des Chevaliers -- it's considered as the world's most preserved medieval castle that sits in the South Western region of the country near Homs. \n\nIt was built almost exactly 1,000 years ago, and despite being damaged a few years ago in the Syrian Civil War, it remains remarkably in tact.  It was a pleasure to explore the ins and outs of this castle today -- I was the only tourist here! \n\nThe historical landmarks are just one of the MANY reasons why I have fallen in love with this Middle Eastern country.

Seriously guys - I can't make this stuff up!  \n\nRiding in a taxi in Syria is like being invited into someone's home for an amazing experience.  They offer you tea, candy and anything else they have in the car.  And most importantly, they smile at you and make you feel safe and comfortable!   \n\nAlso in this video, I didn't mention how CHEAP they are.  A 30 minute ride across the city is around $2USD.  Not a bad deal if you ask me!\n\nIf you're still reading this, I'd just like to extend an extra thank you to everyone who has watched, liked, commented and engaged in my Syria videos so far.  It's been incredible to experience this culture and hospitality first-hand.  It's one of my favorites in the world!

There are 130 people in her class who come from 65 countries and they are constantly traveling, living in 7 different countries for 4 months at a time.  \n\nI'd love to get your thoughts on whether you think this is the future of education or not?

I honestly hadn’t heard about it until a week ago when my friend mentioned it to me in Nauru, and I am completely blown away by what I have seen here.

We sat down and starting chatting, and she started telling me the most somber and vivid stories about how she managed to survive BOTH the recent wars in Syria and Iraq.  I asked for her permission to interview her and share her story, and she was happy to do so because the world needs more empathy for the people of Iraq and Syria. \n\nAya is one of the strongest, most resilient women I've ever met, and I hope you take away something powerful from this video.

It's extremely rare to get a duel-narrative tour of Jerusalem, and I learned more than I ever thought I'd know about the history and politics of Israel & Palestine.\n\nFrom hearing their real-life stories of growing up in segregated Jerusalem, which challenges they've faced, and how they connect to certain parts of the city — to witnessing them being friends and colleagues today, treating each other equally and with respect — is very humbling and reassuring, and this experience has restored my faith in humanity.\n\nI know there are more Yuvals and Samers out there, either living in Israel/Palestine or elsewhere in the world, who treat each other equally and respectfully, despite their religion and/or differences. Maybe — just maybe — this video will spark a light that will start a movement towards peace for Israel and Palestine. I sure hope so.\n\nThis video was by far the most challenging one I've made - from the planning stages, to the on-site shooting (i.e. security checkpoints) and especially, the tedious editing process which took me pretty much 2 full days. I am proud of how it turned out, and I truly hope your perspectives have been opened, or you've learned something new by watching this video.\n\nI welcome your thoughts, opinions and constructive criticism (which I know this will get a lot of)… But I'd like you to think twice about how you say things... If you are going to be an online troll — full of hate and ignorance, and someone who causes further conflict through foolish comments — then please turn your attention elsewhere. I know there are plenty of cat videos on YouTube that you'll probably enjoy ;)\n\nI will only be responding to carefully thought-out comments, reactions and questions in this thread.\n\nThanks again for watching, and the best is yet to come :)\n\nMusic: Kevin MacLeod\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/",

We went all over the country, hiking volcanoes, visiting small villages, touring big cities, etc -- and I loved every second of being there.\n\nEl Salvador, unfortunately, gets a bad reputation on the news & media for being unsafe, and therefore, many tourists avoid going there. I'm here to tell you not to listen to the news and come visit for yourself to see how truly spectacular this country is. I'm not saying crime doesn't exist there (crime is everywhere) -- but as long as you take normal precautions and use common sense (i.e. avoid dangerous areas at night), then you will be fine. Salvadorean People are warm and friendly, and almost everyone is open to having a genuine conversation.\n\nI hope this video changes your perspectives on the beauty of El Salvador.\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

So she recently moved back to her hometown of Niamey, Niger to start an NGO promoting her country's culture and traditions.  In a sense, she is the one and only 'cultural ambassador' for her Niger and she is doing big things like organizing the first international cultural festival in August.\n\nIn our globalized world of fast-paced, cut-throat societies -- it's imperative for us to preserve our beautiful cultures, like Aminata is doing with Niger. \n\nShare this video to help Aminata's goal of putting her country on the map!

(Seriously, this is not a joke!!!)\n\nThe 4 pillars of GNH are: \n- Sustainable development\n- Environmental protection\n- Cultural preservation\n- Good governance \n\nTogether, these 4 pillars have been ingrained in Bhutanese society since 1974, when King Jigme Singye Wangchuck created it. GNH has revolutionized the way in which this country operates, going far beyond happiness of its people. It has led to Bhutan becoming one of the greenest countries in the world and a global leader in sustainability. It's the ONLY country to have negative carbon emissions. This means that its forests absorb more carbon dioxide each year than its sources of pollution (factories) give out. How amazing is that? \n\nThere is so much to admire about Bhutan, and it all stems from Gross National Happiness. \n\nHave any questions about visiting Bhutan?

THIS IS NOT NORMAL.\n\nToday alone, Greenland's ice sheet (the second largest on earth) lost a record 11 billion tons, which rose global ocean levels half a millimeter.   \n\nIt was bizarre to witness this first hand, as our Hurtigruten expedition explored the sea ice on small tender boats.  \n\nNo region on earth is more affected more by climate change than the polar regions, and you don't realize how big the issue is until you see it with your own eyes.  I made this video to raise awareness because it's up to us to fix it.  I am speechless by what I saw today.\n\nPlease share your thoughts, comments and suggestions on climate change.

I've literally had 2 halo-halos every day since I've been back and I'm craving one more halo-halo dessert right now.\n\nHalo-halo is like a snow cone meets ice cream sundae meets sugary fruit cup -- and it's so damn tasty that it's impossible to have one bite. Have you ever tried halo-halo?  What's your favorite thing about halo-halo?  \n\nIt's really cool how different countries have their \"signature dessert\" like halo-halo is to the Philippines... What is the number 1 dessert in your country? Comment below!\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky!

The Middle East is one of my favorite regions to visit for this exact reason.\n\nI get a lot of messages from people telling me to be 'careful' traveling through Muslim countries because I am Jewish...

It doesn't matter whether you are Christian, Buddhist, Hindu or Jewish -- if you travel in Muslim countries, they will welcome you with open arms and food on the table.\n\nI hope that this video teaches you a lesson that Muslims don't hate Jews, and vice versa.

He and another top-line cinematographer will be traveling with me as become one of the youngest people in history to visit every country.  \n\nThis documentary will NOT be anything like my daily travel videos, nor a compilation of my travels.  You've already seen that through my videos. \n\nInstead, the film will take you behind the scenes of what it's really like to visit every country.  It will be personal.  You will hear from my family and close friends.   It will discuss things that I don't ever tell you, like my severe anxiety.  It will reflect on my biggest realizations/takeaways from crossing 197 borders.  We will discuss how dedicated I am to work 15 hour days, 7 days a week for 3 straight years to create these videos, which have amassed 1.2 billion views.  We will talk about how social media has not only allowed me to finance my trips, but it has let me connect with amazing locals (YOU GUYS) -- and how I rely on their generosity to introduce me to their homeland.  We will dive deep into this 'every country' culture, as there are only ~ 200 people who have done it.  And TONS more!\n\nIf you want to stay up to date on our project, please follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinskydocumentary\n\nChris will be sharing a lot of BTS on his Instagram as well: www.instagram.com/look_see_do\n\nI will be investing a lot of my time, energy and money into this project throughout 2020, and I couldn't be more excited to share it with you!\n\nTHANK YOU!!\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

I'm burning out.\n\nMy views & engagement are at an all-time low, whether it's due to FB's annoying algorithm changes or my content has been uninteresting... or both. It's really frustrating when I put all my effort & energy into making these videos -- 17 hours a day -- and I'm not getting rewarded through the only measure I care about... views. \n\nThis has nothing to do with money. My ultimate goal (since I started my first travel blog in 2012) has always been the same -- to inspire as many people as I can to travel the world. I want my content to reach eyeballs of people from all corners of our planet and I want to be a resource to help them plan trips and ultimately create lifelong memories. \n\nI hope that I will get out of this funk soon, or else, I may reconsider my career as a video maker. Or I might take a 5 weeks off during my upcoming Central Africa trip which starts on Monday. We'll see.\n\nThank you to all those who have stuck with me.

It's grimy.  It's loud.  But it's all part of the experience, and I'm excited to share it with you in this video!\n\nWould you ever go to an early morning fish market?

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nThis is a video about one of the most spectacular places on planet earth.  It's a place called BAGAN in the Central part of MYANMAR.  I  came here once 5 years ago, and I am still blown away by what I am seeing!\n\nIn short, there were over 10,000 temples and pagodas built in Bagan between the 9th and 13th Centuries, and it was a center for Buddhism worship in South East Asia.  Today, about 2,700 of these temples remain, ALL IN ORIGINAL FORM, and they are scattered around an area that's 13 kilometers by 8 kilometers large.  It's the biggest UNESCO archeological site in the world.  \n\nIn my opinion, Bagan is 10X more enjoyable than the Angkor region of Cambodia because there's much less tourists here and you can freely roam around on your own to have these magnificent temples all to your self.  \n\nOh yeah, and I forgot to mention that every morning in Bagan is like a hot air balloon festival!  I highly recommend adding Bagan to the very top of your bucket list, and I promise you it won't disappoint!\n\nHas anyone out there been to Bagan?

That's outrageous.\n\nDriving on a motorbike taxi in Bangkok is one of the scariest experiences you can have -- especailly because they rarely provide you with a helmet -- but that's just how life unfolds in this bustling metropolis.\n\nYou'd think that traffic wouldn't be so bad because Bangkok has both an efficient overground AND underground metro system... but it doesn't seem to make any difference.

The Emberas extract black juice from the fruit and use it as an ink that they paint their bodies with, and it stays active for about 2 weeks.   The geometric shapes and designs have been passed down from their ancestors, and they use it today as a sunscreen and shampoo as well.\n\nThis lady, named Lisa, is the main tattoo artist in her community of 24 families and so I wanted to make a story on her life because I find it to be incredible!\n\nAnyone out there have a love for tattoos?

He’s a really cool and friendly guy, who has been kind enough to take me around his country! \n\nNata and his youth group, Hatutan, recently started a LGBT pride parade in the small country of Timor-Leste, which has been making international headlines. Their movement has provided an opportunity to promote social inclusion for everyone in a country where LGBT people have struggled to gain family/social acceptance. \n\nTheir first pride parade was held last year, which attracted 500+ people and was so powerful that it brought in support from the previous Prime Minister. They are already planning their second pride to happen this coming June. \n\nI really admire Nata's approach to make an impact in his country’s society, so I sat him down to question him and learn more about his story. \n\nThis is the longest video I've ever made, at nearly 5 minutes, and also the hardest I've spent editing... I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.\n\nSpecial thanks to PixelAsia and FilmDeit Productions for the extra footage, and to Nata & his friends who helped make this video happen.

Awesome news!\n\nBut perhaps the most inspiring thing about Sayed is how he strives to help other innocent refugees seek asylum and assimilate into Icelandic society, because he is a giver. \n\nThis guy really has a heart of gold, and I can't wait to catch up with him the next time I come to Reykjavík.\n\nAre you on Instagram?

Join me: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nIf you come to Myanmar, then prepare yourself to hear the kissing sound in restaurants, on random street corners and pretty much anywhere you go around this country!  \n\nAt first, you might think it's an inappropriate form of 'cat calling,' but in reality, it's simply a way to get someone's attention.  All you do is simply make a kissing sound two or three times in the direction of the person you want to speak with, and they instantly turn around -- like magic! \n\nThe kissing sound is one of the most unique things about Burmese culture, and honestly speaking, it makes ordering anything in a restaurant a lot more fun!!   \n\nThe bigger moral of this story is about having cultural awareness and etiquette when traveling in foreign countries.  You will often see or experience things that may not be normal to you, but are completely regular in other cultures.  And if you ask me, that's the beauty of travel!  \n\nThank you @Corona for sponsoring this video. \n\n#DrewBinsky #Myanmar #Travel #Sponsored\n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on IG Stories for more untold stories of Myanmar! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\n►FB: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there too!)\n►IG Stories: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\n\nWHO AM I? \nMy name is Drew Binsky and I am going to all 197 countries in the world.

Complete strangers coming up to me on the street, from big cities to small towns, offering me a cup of tea in their shop or a bed to sleep in their home. \n\nI'm convinced that I could come to Iran with $0 in my pocket and easily be able to make friends, find delicious meals and be welcomed in a comfortable home like family. Seriously, it’s almost like Iranian people force you into their homes (in a good way!)\n\nOver the last 2 weeks, I’ve told dozens of Iranians that I am both American and Jewish, and contrary to what you may think, it makes them like me even more, peaking their interest and asking more questions. I have not felt a minuscule of negative hostility yet from anyone in this lovely country called Iran.\n\nAlso, as I have now published 10 videos about Iran so far -- it really makes me laugh when I read some of the comments and hear people calling my videos \"propaganda.\" These videos are the farthest thing away from propaganda!!! They are telling you the downright truth from my experiences in Iran. Nobody told me to make this video (or any video). I made this because I feel the need to share what I am seeing to you. And I hope that by watching this video (and my others about Iran) -- that you will remove your negative stereotypes about this humble nation and realize that it's one of the safest and best places to visit on our planet.\n\nIf you have ever been to Iran, and you agree with what I am saying, then please share your thoughts or a quick moment/story from your experience with the people here. I want the entire world to know!!!\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

Our entire meal was less than $10 each - for dim sum!\n\nTim Ho Wan's started 9 years ago as a hole-in-the-wall dim sum restaurant in Mong Kok - the busiest district of Hong Kong.  The dim sum is so freaking tasty that it has expanded to more than 50 locations in dozens of countries over the last decade. And it's so damn inexpensive!\n\nIt blows my mind how food can be THIS GOOD and THIS CHEAP in one of the world's most expensive cities... But I am surely not complaining!\n\nHave you ever heard of Tim Ho Wan's?  Or tried dim sum before?  Can anyone back me up by how good it is?\n\nFollow Drew Binsky for daily travel videos.

And guess what?  My biggest realization from doing this over the last 7 years is that ALL PEOPLE ARE THE SAME.\n\nJoin me in today's video where I take you on a journey to learn about the 5 most unique tribes I've met in my travels, from Namibia to Ethiopia to Thailand to Yemen and Swaziland.\n\nAs our world quickly becomes more globalized, fewer and fewer indigenous people remain every day.  It's our responsibility (as tourists)  to protect their environments and traditions, because they live in the most simple and sustainable way possible.

Trust me. \n\nI've been wanting to make a video about ice cream rolls since I moved to Thailand in June -- so here it is and I hope you enjoy :)\n\nShare this video if you've tried (or want to try) Thai ice cream rolls!\n\nInstagram: @drewbinsky   \n\nSpecial thanks to Michael (IG @affinityadventure) for the intro sequence.

Saad, in El Jadida, and Hajar, in Casablanca. \n\nI cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this experience has been!\n\n10 years ago, or even 5 years ago (when Snapchat was founded), it would have not been possible to meet Saad and Hajar. If it wasn't for social media, I would have never met their wonderful families, eaten their delicious home-cooked meals, slept in their comfortable beds or enjoyed the presence of their smiling faces. \n\nI am very grateful for the times we live in. Many people see our \"social media\" generation as a disaster, that we are constantly glued to our phones all day long, etc. But I will always argue against them. What has happened to me over the last 5 days in Morocco is a perfect example. I am living proof. Social media (i.e. Facebook) has also connected me with you. \n\nWhat's your take on our 'social media generation?' Have you met others through social media on your travels?\n\nP.S. -- I'd like to let all of you know that Arabic hospitality is truly the best in the world. I've never been treated with more respect and sincerity than in Arabic countries. Similar situations have happened to me in Kuwait, Oman, Jordan and Bahrain. \n\nMusic: Audio Autix\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

        "description": "This story will make you smile :)\n\nIt's about a 70-year-old Priest, Father Pedro, and how he has given a life to over 1 MILLION people who are living in extreme poverty in Antananarivo, Madagascar. An Argentinean native, Pedro first came to Madagascar in 1970, and after witnessing some of the world's most brutal living conditions -- he decided to do something about it. \n\nSo in 1989, he raised €900 from Christian missionaries to create a community called Akamasou -- which offers jobs, schools and a better life for the people living in extreme poverty. Year after year, Pedro got more funding as the word spread about his initiative. \n\nToday, Akamasou is a massive self-sufficient town which sustains more 25,000 people regularly, and has provided food, shelter & clothes to over a million people since opening its doors 30 years ago. \n\nPedro's philosophy is, \"If you are not willing to work (or study), then you are not allowed to eat.\" And once you join his community, you are offered a very nice house and life than is unparalleled to living on the streets of the city. \n\nToday has been one of the best travel memories of my life. Thank you Pedro for hosting me, and thank you to my local friends Ali, Dave, Nancy and Antonio for driving me here and helping translate from French to English! \n\nI don't ask you to share my videos often, but if you enjoyed this one, please share it so more people can hear this inspiring story.  It will take a global effort to end extreme poverty.\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

Now try to imagine doing that in Iran, 1,800 years ago!\n\nHere in Yazd, Iran -- I’ve learned the different methods for how ancient humans in this area survived dating back to the 3rd Century. To get water, they would dig a system of deep underground tunnels (up to 300 meters deep) to find wells, and somehow, find a way to funnel down the water into the towns. \n\nIt’s summer right now in Iran, and let me tell you, it’s BLISTERING HOT outside here. Reminds me of summers back home in Phoenix, Arizona. I cannot imagine the struggles these people went through to survive. \n\nPutting the history aside, the old town of Yazd is stunning with the most beautifuly-crafted blue-tiled mosque and a thriving shopping scene at the bazaar! \n\nHave you ever heard of Yazd, or been here to Iran before?

WHO KNEW?!\n\nWords cannot express how sincerely I've been treated so far in Malawi -- by every single person I've come in contact with. Malawi is the most laid back, peaceful and genuine place I've been over the last 4 weeks in Africa. \n\nNot ONCE has anyone asked me for money. Not ONCE have I been treated disrespectfully. Not ONCE have I felt intimidated or scared to interact with any locals. Malawians have accepted me with open arms, and for that, I am grateful.  I sincerely love Malawi! \n\nDo you also agree that it's the people (in any given country) which can make or break your experience? That's why I love the Philippines so much as well!! Which country do you think has the nicest people? \n\nSong by Kevin MacLeod\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post more videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew@drewbinsky.com",

If not, then you’re in for a treat when you hear about these magical Angkor Temples (also where the movie Tomb Raider was filmed)!!\n\nI’m thrilled to be back in Siem Reap, Cambodia for the first time in 4.5 years — the town has evolved a lot since I last remembered. Today I went on a tour that I found on KKday, in which a private guide named Lonh showed us all over this ancient city. I learned so much in one day that I can't even begin to explain -- so I hope you learn a thing or two in this video! \n\nDo you also agree that the Angkor temples in Cambodia are the most underrated landmark in Asia?

        "description": "Earlier today, in the middle of a small Sri Lankan village, I met a guy named Dhramadsa who has been carving wood for 47 years!   \n\nI spontaneously sat him down to hear about his life story, and I was shocked to find out that he's been at this wood carving job for nearly a half-century!\n\nThis is not your ordinary wood carvings... Dhramadsa molds the most detailed animal sculptures (elephants, tigers, etc) starting with an empty block of wood.   Each piece takes him roughly 2 weeks of work (nonstop), and he sells them in local markets for around $100 USD each.   \n\nDoes he do it for the money?  Absolutely not.  It's just hobby that keeps him busy.  He's very content living a simple life in his beautiful village, and he plans to carve wood until he dies!\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky for daily travel content!!

Well, after that incidence, these two ladies were fed up from all the negativity & hate that their beloved country (Malaysia) was getting... So, in effort to better unify their diverse nation, they created a movement called The Rojak Projek, where they traveled to every region in Malaysia to make colorful portraits of people by using FOOD as the ART. \n\nOver the last 3 years, they have already made 540 food portraits around Malaysia, and they are wrapping up on their 550th to honor Malaysia's 55th birthday coming up in a few weeks. \n\nFaye and Rachel's story is one of the most innovative and impactful I've witnessed. They are opening so many doors for the togetherness of Malaysian people, as well as sending a positive message to the outside world -- and I'm happy that I got to experience it first hand. \n\nTo end this script on an unrelated note...

Let me introduce you to a lovely borough called Brooklyn, which is (in my opinion) the epitome of the word \"hipster.\" It's a lot more quiet, artsy and residential than Manhattan, which is amazing because I could actually breathe in some fresh air without getting trampled by people. (Not hating on Manhattan, just pointing out the differences).\n\nMy best friend from college, Isaac, recently moved to Brooklyn. He is a hip hop/funk/house DJ on the side, and he gave me an inside tour of his neighborhood called Bushwick.\n\nHave you ever been to Brooklyn?

Connect w/ travelers for free: https://apple.co/3vYPr75 \n✅ SUBSCRIBE for more travel videos: https://bit.ly/3iAZlnw\n\nIn Mumbai, India, I took a tour of the biggest slum in the world called Dharavi.  \n\nAlso made famous by the movie Slumdog Millionaire, Dharavi has well over 1 million people living in a space that's half the size of Central Park in NYC. Walking through Dharavi was the most eye-opening and real experience that I've ever had. At first, I was nervous and I thought it'd be unsafe and scary, but I was proven wrong. I learned how productive the people work and how much this slum produces to the Indian economy. Everything there is VERY well organized with industrial factories and residential neighborhoods. Dhravi is over a billion-dollar industry, using recycled foods to produce everything from aluminum to leather to pottery, and they make everything by hand. The poverty levels and dirty streets are nothing like I've seen in my life, with most people working 15 hours a day in extreme hot weather for just $1-3 USD per day. But above all, most people didn't seem unhappy. I saw hundreds of smiling faces on the kids as they were giving me hi-fives when I walked past them. It was both humbling and mentally exhausting and something I'll never forget. I think everyone should see Dharavi with their eyes because then you'll begin to appreciate how much you have in life.\n\nFor more, check out my travel blog http://thehungrypartier.com/",

We met (in person) for the first time 4 days ago, and we get along so well that I can already tell we will be friends for life.\n\nI'm guessing you already know something about him already, as he's been in my last 3 videos around Lebanon, but his artistic talents are so unique that I wanted to share with you how he makes a living -- by drawing monsters on his phone!\n\nSide note: We live in such a cool generation. I am seeing more and more people turning their passion into careers than ever before. We are collectively finding ways to work creatively, remotely and efficiently using the internet. Cheers to all of the \"Georgios\" out there who are following their dreams!\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\nP.S. THANK YOU to Georgio and his family for giving me the best tour of Lebanon ever.

What does this mean?  It means that she gets free accommodation and gets to bond with the cutest pets, while having the ability to discover new cities around the world.  She's already been to Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and next is Malaysia -- and because she works online, her office can be from anywhere! Sounds like a dream life, right?  \n\nI got connected with Vanessa last week after she contacted me on TrustedHousesitters before Deanna and I went to Myanmar for Valentine's Day.  We needed someone to watch our baby pug, Dudoy, and she was the very first person to reach out.  \n\nWe are just blown away by how incredible the experiences has been, as well as how amazing Vanessa's life is!   We felt very comfortable knowing that she was in our apartment and caring for our baby pug.  It was a win-win for everyone involved, with no money exchange.  We benefited from someone incredible watching our dog, and she benefited from getting a free place to stay and enjoying Dudoy's company. \n\nThank you TrustedHousesitters for helping making this video happen (sponsored), and I highly suggest you guys to get involved whether you're a pet-loving traveler or a pet-owner.

The long layovers, unexpected delays, dangerous situations, difficulties of getting visas and daunting immigration checks ALL WHILE creating videos every day has led me to have severe anxiety.\n\nBut there is one way that I temporarily cure my anxiety, and that is by playing the sport of golf.

I never want to bore you! But the truth is that this sport has played a huge part of my life since I was 12 and\nI always wanted to be a professional golfer. In today's video, I want to open up and share how golf has helped keep me sane amid this stressful lifestyle on the road.\n\nFor all of you workaholics out there, I urge you to find a sport, game, hobby or skill that you can practice to keep your mind healthy.

In the early 1940s, when she was about 10, the Japanese took control of her country (and most of the Pacific Islands) during WWII.\n\nRose was held hostage for years on Jaluit atoll, and she told me harrowing stories from what she experienced.  \n\nShe was only fed 1 meal per day.  She had to dig a hole in the sand to hide from being killed.  And if she ever made the slightest mistake, then she would get a limb cut off, which she saw happen to her friends and family. \n\nIt’s important than we must never forget these tragedies that happened in the past — in our parents and grandparents lifetimes — which is why I've decided to highlight Rose's story in today's video.\n\nI'd also like to add that Rose is a very strong woman who was not shy to answer my questions, even though I was intimidated to ask her.  Today, she lives a very happy life with her family, and she's a dance choreographer!

This is perhaps the most rewarding part about going abroad!\n\nYesterday, I had the pleasure to meet a young lady named Zaida -- who not only founded the 'top' restaurant in Dili, Timor-Leste -- but she cooks ALL the food single-handedly! Whether there is 1 guest or 100 guests, she will have her hands busy in the kitchen (and I can attest that her food is AMAZING). \n\nZaida has a very interesting background, coming from Guinea-Bissau, spending most of her life in Portugal and now the last decade in Timor-Leste. All 3 countries are geographical opposites, but they are binded together by the Portuguese language (yes, they speak Portuguese in Timor-Leste!) Her food is a combination of Portuguese, West African and Southeast Asian flavors. \n\nIf you ever find yourself in Timor-Leste., you need to stop by her restaurant for a bite to eat!\n\nP.S. This video was impromptu -- my friend Nata (from yesterday's video) told me about Zaida, and I spontaneously decided to make this video. Zaida is quite shy on camera, so we had to motivate her extra hard to film :)\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

That's what's happening to me right now, at Persepolis in Iran. \n\nPersepolis is the name of the former capital of the Achaemenid (Persian) Empire. Archaeologists and historians believe that this city began being built in 518 BC - or 2,530 years ago. \n\nToday, as you wander around Persepolis, you can see incredible stone columns and walls with extremely detailed inscriptions, giving us insight for how these humans used to live their lives. The most impressive thing to me is that nothing in Persepolis is restored -- it's all in its original form. I cannot imagine how much more polished Persepolis looked back in its heyday! \n\nAfter spending all day exploring Persepolis and being so stunned that my jaw is dropped to the ground, I cannot understand why it's not considered in any of the '7 wonder of the world' lists. I have been to all 7 wonders on each list, and Persepolis would easily be in my top 3!!!!\n\nHave you ever heard of Persepolis?

I’ve spent the past 2 days at Myjava Folklore Festival in the countryside of Western Slovakia, and it’s been absolutely incredible!! \n\nIt’s completely opposite to the \"popular festivals\" of today, such as Coachella, which involve DJs, drugs, Instagram selfies and late nights.  At this annual festival in Myjava, a town of just 10,000 people, everyone comes together to celebrate tradition and culture through music, dancing and songs. \n\nIt's one of the happiest environments I've ever seen, and it kind of makes me wish to be living in the past!   Would you rather live 100 years in the past or 100 years in the future?\n\nAre you on Instagram? Follow @DrewBinsky for daily travel stories on there (I'm on my way now to Algeria!)

It's a tradition.\n\nNot only is this the first time I've commonly see a man PAY for his bride, but it's also the first time I've seen anyone use PIGS to pay in the same exact way that they use currency. \n\nAre you as confused as I am right now?\n\nPapua New Guinea is truly a magnificent country if you like getting off the beaten path.

But there is a softer side of the city with many hidden treasures (and UNESCO sites), which I've been slowly discovering today! \n\nI am thrilled for the next 14 days as I take you deeper inside Iranian life, culture and historical landmarks of one of the world's oldest civilizations… but more importantly, break the negative stereotype that Iran has been receiving for decades. \n\nOur route around Iran will be Tehran, and then Yazd, Kerman, Shiraz, Persepolis, Isfahan, Kashan and then back to Tehran. \n\nDo you have any tips for Iran?

Her story is as inspiring as they come!  \n\nDesirée originally comes from a Jewish family in Zagreb, Yugoslavia and when she was 19 (April 1941), she woke up to the sound of bombs from the Nazis, and was forced into camps in Italy where she spent 4 years.  \n\nShe ended up being the only person in her family to make it out alive, and then immigrated to the United States to start a new life.\n\nDesirée was always an artist as a child, but never had the opportunity to pursue her dreams because of her daunting childhood -- so at 52 years young, she enrolled at Cal State Fullerton for her undergrad, and later received a masters in art. \n\nShe makes the most incredible ceramic pieces and displays them in art galleries as well as on her front porch.  Not bad for someone who is about to turn 100!\n\nI am so thankful that I was able to connect with Desirée -- she is so sharp for her age and honestly is the happiest person I've ever met!  I can't wait to catch up with her in years to come. \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more inspiring stories from around the world: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\nP.S. - Extreme measures and precautions were taken to meet Desirée (mask, gloves, 10 feet social distancing).  I also was tested negative in recent days before meeting her.

If you hike up the hills, you will find a touristy community called Sacromonte.  If you keep hiking up like 15 more minutes, you will find about 40-50 free-spirited travelers and modern hippies who are living in small caves without electricity or running water.  I spend a few hours here today, speaking with several \"locals,\"  and it was incredible to hear about their alternate lifestyles.\n\nThis reminded me a lot of Auroville in India and Arcosanti in Arizona.

They go to school together, play sports together (basketball & taekwondo), hang out together and support each other's bright future.

While this may be the case for some zoos in the world, there are several others I've visited who are working hard to protect & conserve animals and our ecosystems. \n\nYesterday, I visited the Naples Zoo at Caribbean Gardens in Florida, where I was able to meet with Uno -- a blind panther that they rescued on the street and have taken under their wing. Without their efforts, Uno would not be alive, and the vulnerable species of the Florida Panther would have one less member (there are about ~200 living today).\n\nWhat are your thoughts on zoos?

        "description": "While sitting on the beach today in Phuket, we were approached by a lovely lady named Mona Lisa.  She offered to give me (and my parents) a massage, which we easily agreed because of her kindness and warming personality. \n\nNot only was her massage one of the best I've ever had, but her story is so eye opening that I decided to make this impromptu video.   \n\nShe has been working for 10 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year on this exact beach since 1979, while raising 5 children.  The kicker? She makes an average of $25 USD per day. \n\nMeeting people like Mona Lisa is always a reality check for me to appreciate the life that I live, because I am lucky.  And if you are reading this right now, then you are also lucky because you have a computer and/or phone and internet access. \n\nAll too often, we take these things in our lives for granted.  \n\nInstagram @drewbinsky \n\nPS-- This video was entirely shot on my iPhone 10XS and Osmo Pocket.  It's the first time in 520+ videos that I didn't use my GH5 and mic.  Personally, I think the quality of the footage isn't so bad, but the audio needed help.

They asked me if I was interested to go to Georgia to make videos about him and his country 🇬🇪I said absolutely YES, and they said we want you to come now… Immediately.  \n\nSo they booked us a flight on the spot and the next minute, Michael and I were on a plane to Tbilisi, Georgia!!  This video explains our spontaneous story thus far.\n\nI came here once back in 2015 as a budget backpacker and loved it, and I’m thrilled to have this unique opportunity to see Georgia for the next few days alongside Bera.  He’s a really cool and down to earth guy and we’ve already had a blast together. \n\nWe will be covering a LOT in a short time, so stay tuned on Instagram @drewbinsky to follow our trip!\n\nThank you Michael (IG: @affinityadventure) for filming and editing this video.

What an exciting, adventurous and spontaneous year 2017 has been -- without question, the best year of my life! In this video, I share my top 10 highlights of the year after visiting 43 countries, 79 cities, 6 continents and making hundreds of new friends and thousands of lifelong memories.\n\n365 days ago, on January 1, 2017, Deanna randomly surprised me with a Canon EOSM3, and it inspired me to start making videos. At first, my growth was slow and frustrating -- as I only posted about 2 videos on FB per month... But I stuck with it, keep grinding and learning, and 143 videos later, I am humbled to say more than 54 million people have watched my videos.\n\nIt's crazy to look back over the years and see how I've transitioned every year to something else. In 2013, I graduated college from UW-Madison. In 2014, I was making a full-time income from teaching English in South Korea. In 2015, I was living off travel blogging (affiliate marketing, advertising & sponsors). In 2016, I was collaborating with huge brands on Snapchat, and monetizing that platform was enough to earn income while traveling for free. And in 2017, I've found my niche with short travel videos (which I honestly enjoy the most!) and I've been able to attract even bigger sponsors. I also just upgraded cameras to a Panasonic Lumix GH5!\n\nWhatever you do in life, you have to keep making the necessary pivots to keep climbing up the ladder. I am so excited to see what's in store for 2018!\n\nTHANK YOU TO ALL MY FAMILY, FRIENDS AND NEW FACES I MET IN 2017 WHO MADE THIS YEAR SO SPECIAL FOR ME. If one thing's for sure, this ride is going to continue moving forward.\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post more videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew@drewbinsky.com",

As a linguistics major, Chia Wei was already learning sign language (before she knew that Amni was deaf)... and the rest is history :)\n\nI hope you enjoy this video as much as I enjoyed meeting these girls and hearing their story in real life!\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky.

Against all odds, he got a degree from a top university and went on to teach himself how to bartend (which was not easy to do in Mexico).  \n\nNow, he has been to 31 countries and over 50 cities to bartend for people around the world and he's only getting started!  What an incredible guy and he is proof that anything is possible if you put your mind to it.  If you ever make it to Mexico City, you have to find him at either Baltra or Limantour --he would be glad to make you a drink!\n\nThank you Corona for making this video possible. \n\nFollow @Drew Binsky on Instagram for more stories from every country: https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Mexico #Travel #Sponsored\n\nTEXT ME! +1 310 349 3854, I will respond :)\n\nWANT EXCLUSIVE TRAVEL TIPS OR A PERSONALIZED SHOUTOUT?

I just completed the most amazing, spiritual and life-changing hike up to the famous Tiger's Nest near Paro, Bhutan. It's my last day in the country of Bhutan, and this has absolutely been the highlight thus far. \n\nTiger's Nest is the name of a 17th Century Monastery complex, which has 9 temples and sits on top of a very steep cliff overlooking Western Bhutan. It's one of the most remarkable places I've seen in all of my travels. \n\nAt the start of the 12km hike, you can't anything because of the low hanging clouds, which swallow the green mountains. As you hike up and up, you will find a variety of Buddhist temples, waterfalls, and prayer flags decorating the sidelines. Monks are seen everywhere practicing their rituals, as this is one of the most sacred sites in all of Buddhism. The fact that it's currently rainy season makes this hike 3X as hard, as we trekked for hours and hours uphill in sloppy wet mud.\n\nAnd then, BOOM, the first sight of Tiger's Nest is something I'll never forget. Ever.  BHUTAN IS AMAZING!!\n\nThank you to all of my new Bhutanese friends who made this past week so special for me, and I hope to be back again for round 2 soon!\n\nIf you have any questions about Bhutan, comment them below and I'll get back to you.\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

Out of the 161 videos I've made, this one is amongst my favorites. \n\nYesterday, I went on an INCREDIBLE tour of the Makuleke private concession in Kruger National Park -- which is way up on the Northeastern tip of South Africa, bordering Zimbabwe and Mozambique. This 240 square kilometer area represents just 1% of Kruger's total area, but contains more than 75% of the biodiversity. \n\nI've seen a wealth of animals (elephant, giraffe, warthog, hippo, buffalo, lion, zebra, antelope, wildebeest, crocodile, baboon, hyena, 480+ species of birds), and not to mention, we are surrounded by untouched bush landscape with rocks dating back 250 million years. \n\nThe guy who toured me around, Bruce, is world-renowned for his expert skill & knowledge in birds and dangerous game animals in South Africa. Bruce is like the 'Michael Jordan of the Wilderness,' and I learned so much from him which I hope to share with you in this special video! \n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post more videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew@drewbinsky.com",

Prepare yourselves to be introduced to the mouth-watering foods of MAURITIUS! (There are many things I am loving about Mauritius, and I think the food might be my favorite so far).\n\nWe traveled deep into the rural areas of Mauritius's main island to meet two AMAZING grandmothers, who welcomed us into their houses and cooked us one of the best local meals I've had in recent memory.\n\nMarie-Michelle and Brigitte started their business 5 years ago called Kot Marie-Michelle -- a reservation-only restaurant and cooking-class of Mauritian cuisine in the comfort of their own home. Every fruit, vegetable, meat and spice you will find here is homegrown and prepared, as fresh as it gets.\n\nThis video is about our experience today at their house, and the story of how they got started from picking sugarcane in the nearby fields to cooking the best Mauritian food you can find on the island.\n\nIf you come to Mauritius, do yourself a favor and find these ladies for an experience you'll never forget!!\n\nSpecial Thanks to Mauritius Tourism for inviting us here, and to Solana Beach Mauritius for hosting us!\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

        "description": "This 5 minute video highlights the story of an amazing man, Mr. Big, who I've spent the last 3 days with eating & traveling around Thailand.\n\nHe's one of the most incredible and inspiring people I've ever met. \n\nMr. Big, a native of Bangkok, quit his job 10 years ago as a real estate mogul to pursue his dream in the food business -- because he LOVES EATING more than anyone else I've met. \n\nNot only has he found success over the last few years -- in the form of a popular Thai TV show and opening up KRBB butchery in Bangkok serving the finest cuts of Japanese & Thai beef -- but he prioritizes in giving back to young farmers in the province to help them grow. \n\nMr. Big, unexpectedly, invited Deanna and I to northern Thai province of Nan to get a new experience of Thailand and see where he sources his pigs (he covered all our expenses and wouldn't let us pay for anything).\n\nWhile in Nan, we met some of the young farmers that he supports by giving them opportunities to succeed, such as taking them on trips to Japan to learn from the masters themselves. Mr. Big is the definition of a role model to these kids. \n\nAlso - Mr. Big kept repeating his philosophy in life, which is to keep giving back, and in the long run, you will eventually get back in return. He doesn't care about money. He geniunely wants to see others succeed. \n\nThese are only the bullet points of Mr. Big's story -- I encourage you to learn the rest in this video, that I am very proud of! \n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

The hardest part is to 'start,' and then so many new opportunities will come out of it, I promise! \n\nIt's been great meeting Mathias and playing a few rounds together over the last few weeks.  Golf is one of the only things to do these days as everything is closed, and of course, we are always maintaining a social distance.  \n\nSpecial thanks to @Troon for letting us shoot at Troon North Golf Club - one of the best in Arizona! \n\nFollow @DrewBinsky on Instagram for more inspiring stories like this one! https://instagram.com/drewbinsky\n\n#DrewBinsky #Golf #Arizona\n\nTEXT ME +1 310 349 3854 and I will respond :) \n\nDo you want exclusive travel advice, need help planning a trip or want a personalized shoutout?

Seriously?\n\nAs someone who's been traveling for 6 years nonstop, I can confidently say that you can travel on $50/day if you spend your money wisely. I've even budgeted myself on $20/day for 3 months in India! Sure, it won't be as pretty as staying at 5 star hotels, but in the end, who cares? It's the experiences you have and the people you meet that will remain in your mind forever.\n\nThe bottom line is this: If you really want to travel, then stop buying materialistic things that you don't need, and put that money away in a travel fund. With a little self-discipline, it is easier than you think.\n\nJust curious -- Can any other travelers out there back me up that $50/day is more than enough to travel?\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

The journey took us hours and hours of driving up steep dirt roads, picking up a hitchhiker who helped give us directions, and running into little boys who were herding hundreds of sheep across the open plains. Lesotho is full of surprises!\n\nThe 3 women were ecstatic when we visited them, and it was a very humbling experience to witness their lifestyle overall.

The 14 of us arrived in Ban Sam Kha -- a tiny Northern Thai village of 170 families, tucked away in the mountains and nestled in between luscious rice fields.\n\nIt was the simplest day I've spent in a long time.  \n\nWhen we arrived, we were welcomed into the village in a lovely Buddhist ceremony then invited for some home cooked dinner.  The following morning, we caught sunrise in the rice fields and learned how to harvest rice (it's harvesting season now!).  To wrap it up, we spent some time with kids in the school and they taught us how to weave Buddhist flags.\n\nIt feels like life moves in slow motion here.  Nobody is rushing to get anywhere.  And everyone is always smiling!  This place is a true paradise. \n\nSometimes when I spend too much time in cities, I forget how relaxing it is in the countryside (anywhere in the world).  It's like hitting the \"reset button\" on life.  I recommend taking a day trip to some small village sometime soon.  You will thank me later!\n\nInstagram @drewbinsky.

Shortly after, we started dating. When I found out that she also works online (remotely), we started traveling together and figuring out how to monetize and sustain a live of full-time travel.\n\nFrom the outside, it looks easy; like we live in a fantasy world -- but believe me, it's not always rainbows and ponies... Nobody realizes how many hours we sit on our computers everyday to make our dreams become a reality. Nobody realizes the stress, annoyances and delays that travel naturally brings upon us. It's a constant battle.\n\nThis video (love story) is about how we manage to live and work remotely - from the ups and downs and all the adventures in between. It's really amazing how technology, the internet and social media has enabled us to live a lifestyle like this. It wouldn't be possible to do this 5 years ago, and that's why sometimes only millennials can understand us.\n\nDeanna can be camera shy, so I had to give her some extra courage to make this video!!! ❤ We hope you like it, and maybe some of you can relate to our lifestyle as well?!\n\nMusic: Ben Sound & Kevin MacLeod\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

Whatever decisions they were -- good or bad -- they have all carved your unique path in life and made you the person you've become.\n\nThe 3 best decisions of my life were going to college at Wisconsin, studying abroad in Prague and teaching English in Korea. If I didn't make any of these choices, then you probably wouldn't be reading this right now because I wouldn't be making travel videos. \n\nWhat are the 3 best decisions of your life?

        "description": "There are few people I've met in my life where I feel like they are truly changing the world of education for the better.  Natalie, from Hong Kong, is one of them.\n\nIt wasn't until she traveled all around the world when she finally realized that life actually had meaning. Before that, despite going to great schools and having a dream consulting job, she was depressed and suicidal for years. School, homework and expectations were overwhelming and they seemed pointless to her. \n\nNatalie realized that ultimately her mission was to give other people a shortcut to discover their own path and passion, so they don't have to go through all the pain that she did.\n\nInstead of following the standard teacher route, she wanted to create a bigger impact -- so she started OWN Academy 自由學園 to build an innovative education ecosystem that focuses on real world learning and equips students with future-proof skills. \n\nHer different approach involves learning outside of the four-walled classroom, identifying industry professionals as mentors, and teaching students the latest industry knowledge to gain valuable insights. The future of education is about bringing the stakeholders of Students, Parents, Schools and Industries together through connecting them with purpose and value exchange. She believes that every student is smart in his or her own ways and is ready to help all students reach their full potentials. \n\nNatalie's initiative has already impacted 2,000+ students and families with bigger goals of expanding internationally. \n\nThis video is her full story — please share if you agree that she represents the future of education! \n\nInstagram @drewbinsky.

AND THAT IDEA WAS TO DELIVER 10,000 WATER PURIFYING STRAWS TO KIDS AND FAMILIES IN KENYA.  Please help me achieve my goal (link to donate: http://bit.ly/2AwhduJ)\n\nIt's finally happening!  To kick off 2018, I'm heading on a solo trip to Africa for 2 months -- from South Africa to Kenya & everywhere in between.  This will be my first time in sub-Saharan Africa (I've only been to North Africa), so it's going to be a completely new experience, and I can't wait!\n\nAs my trip to Kenya comes closer, I've been educating myself about the people and culture of the countries I'll be visiting.  I want to do as much as I can to help those living in poverty.  \n\nMy research led me to the devastating water crisis in Africa, which is currently affecting 400 MILLION people and claiming 4,000 LIVES every day.  Without clean water, you can’t stay in school, you can’t grow food, you can’t go to work and you can’t stay healthy.  It hit me immediately.    \n\nI came across a product called THE STRAW, which makes any contaminated water source safe to drink. \nYou wear it around you neck, stick it in any water source and suck normally as the passing water gets purified into your body.  It's an amazing product that caught my attention.  \n\nI pitched my idea to deliver 10,000 straws to a charity called Water is Life -- who’s mission is to provide clean drinking water, sanitation & hygiene education programs to schools and villages in poverty.  They loved my idea, and introduced me to a village in Kisumu, Kenya, whose residents are in desperate need of drinkable water.    \n\nKenya it is. \n\nSo that's the story of what has been happening...  Now, I need YOUR HELP to bring straws to these kids and families who desperately need them.  \n\nIf you'd like to donate you can do so by PayPal or debit/credit card on this link:  http://bit.ly/2AwhduJ\n\nEach straw costs $7, but any amount will contribute. If everyone following this page donates $1, that will be $15,000 raised.  I will be making daily videos while on the ground, showing exactly which kids your money will be helping.  \n\nWhether you are able to donate or not, I would really appreciate if you could SHARE this video (it's on Facebook too) to help me raise awareness about the ongoing water crisis. \n\nI've decided to personally donate 10 cents for every share this video gets -- so 1,000 shares is $100 donated, and 10,000 shares is $1,000 out of my pocket.  Make me donate more. \n\nWater is Life also agreed to donate 1 straw for every 10 shares -- so 1,000 shares is 100 straws, and 10,000 shares is 1,000 straws. \n\nI rarely ask you guys to share any of my videos, but please, share this one and let's make this world a better place one straw at a time :) \n\nMusic: Kevin MacLeod\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew@drewbinsky.com",

Or think that us humans evolved from chimpanzees? I do!!!\n\nI've been skeptical about evolution all my life until this morning, when I hung out with the chimpanzees in Uganda's Kibale National Park. They are our closest living relative, sharing 98% of our DNA, and you wouldn't believe how similar we are to them until you see how they act in real life!! Way more so than the mountain gorillas I saw yesterday.\n\nThe way they sit, the way they talk, the way they eat, the way they shake hands with each other, and the way they look at you is the strangest thing in the world. Not to mention, every detail in their hands, feet, eyes, mouths and bodies are almost identical to ours!\n\nOur group was lucky enough to be surrounded by a massive group of chimps (20+) and when the “boss” came running in... I witnessed the whole group of chimps jumping up and down, running around, screaming their heads off and swinging on trees. I was scared sh*tless at first, but eventually came around to embrace their presence and realize they will not harm me.\n\nIn my humble opinion, I recommend seeing the chimpanzees 10X over seeing the mountain gorillas in Uganda (+ the permit is a LOT cheaper).

Join me @drewbinsky!\n\nDo you think North Korea & South Korea should be reunified into one country?\n\nLast week, Kim Jong-un became the first North Korean leader to step foot in South Korea since the Korean war ended, in 1953. \n\nHe shook hands, shared a laugh and signed a denuclearization with South Korea's President, Moon Jae-in, as the entire world had their eyes dialed in on this pivotal moment. \n\nAs some of you may already know, I have a very strong connection to the Korean peninsula. I lived and taught English in South Korea for 2 years, and I visited North Korea last year for 4 days.

Street vendors open all night selling the tastiest Thai treats (pad thai, pork noodles, mango sticky rice, etc).\n\nEven if you hate drinking liquor and partying, it's worth coming to Khao San Road for the people watching.

I read about it online, and showed up early morning to see what it's all about.\n\nTurns out, this place is amazing! It's a giant workshop that makes the most beautiful rugs and hanging carpets out of sheep wool, from start to finish. They do everything in house, hand-weaving each rug to perfection. Every artist (weaver) has their own designs, but they also take custom orders if you bring them a photo -- they will duplicate it.\n\nThis video probably won't get the most views or likes, but it was so interesting to see how these carpets are made and I ma happy to share their story with you. \n\nMore to come tomorrow from the unique Himba Tribe of Namibia!\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

All 7.44 billion of us have the same needs in life (shelter, food, water, happiness, love) -- regardless of race, ethnicity, age, religion, health & income. \n\nIt's unfortunate that the news & media is filled with the 0.01% of 'bad people' doing bad things (terrorist attacks, robberies, shootings, rape)— which makes us scared of the world, and gives us a bad impression of what it's actually like to visit certain countries. Don't let terrorism and fear stop you from traveling and chasing your dreams. \n\nI hope this video makes you realize how many people (that you've never met) have your back :) \n\nMusic: Ben Sound\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

        "description": "Hi Friends! I'm thrilled to announce the launch of my new 'JUST GO' T-shirts for a limited time of 2 weeks: https://www.bonfire.com/drew-binsky-just-go/\n\nYou may have seen me wearing these shirts over the last month or so -- it represents my favorite two words in the English language!  JUST GO!\n\nThis simple slogan of JUST GO contains all the motivation you need to get out there and see the world. To buy that airplane ticket, to take that leap of faith and to create lifelong memories.\n\nFor most people (including myself), the hardest part about traveling is to START. We always tend to overthink things and make excuses... So if you JUST GO, then you are getting in the mindset to be spontaneous, and you are putting yourself in position to step out of your comfort zone. The rest of the story is out there waiting to be discovered. \n\nAs part of this T-shirt announcement, I AM GIVING AWAY 10 FREE \"JUST GO\" SHIRTS over the next 24 hours. To win one, simply tag 3 travel-loving friends who would like this shirt, and tell me where you're gonna wear it when it arrives at your doorstep. All winners will be randomly chosen in 24 hours.\n\nIf you have been enjoying the free videos that I've been making over the last 18 months, then the best way to give back if by purchasing one of these shirts to wear on your next trip (link below). It comes in 5 colors and we ship globally.

It's called Babcock Ranch and it’s in South Western Florida. \n\nBabcock Ranch is America’s first solar powered town — 100% powered by the sun. This means that they produce more energy than they consume, as almost a half million solar panels are laid out in nearby fields and on top of commercial buildings. They have driverless electronic shuttles that take you around, work out machines that pump energy back in to the ground, top-of-the-line technology readily available and even free WiFi everywhere in town (including outside)!! \n\nBabcock Ranch is setting the standard for future cities across the U.S.A and the world, and I’m lucky to be able to witness it first hand. They are planning to have 19,500 homes on 6 million square feet of commercial space.\n\nHave you ever heard of Babcock Ranch? Or do you know of any other towns that are on their way to be 100% solar powered? \n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

Well, I'm so glad I met him because he introduced me to his musical friends who run the famous band and YouTube channel Madpuppet Studio.\n\nMadpuppet Studio began back in 2012, when 3 high school friends named Jane, Oat and Nut made a cover song and put it on YouTube. Fast forward 6 years, and now they are the most famous cover band & production team in Thailand with hundreds of millions of video views.\n\nBUT the story doesn't end there. Wait until you hear about the band's amazing concept!\n\nInstead of being selfish and 'shining in the spotlight' -- the 3 original band members have decided to provide opportunities to other young musicians who want to play with them. So each new music video they record for their YouTube Channel features other talented musicians that they have recruited. \n\nI joined their studio recording yesterday and was completely amazed by what I saw. Not to mention, every single one of them is EXTREMELY talented and gifted, and their video/audio production is the best I've ever seen in my life. \n\nFor more of their videos, head over to their YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/user/Madpuppetstudio\n\n► SUBSCRIBE for daily travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Are you on Instagram?

I took full advantage of this 2 hours, to mingle and interact with the locals on the sidelines, who were cheering me on and giving me hi-fives! Pyongyang is actually not what you think it is.

After you buy your fish, you can enjoy it at one of the local restaurants, where they will prepare it for you.\n\nIf you have enough courage at the fish market, you must try the live octopus!

What do you think is the best part of the state? \n\nHaving spent the last 2 days in the South Western regions of Charlotte Harbor, Punta Gorda and Englewood -- this place takes my vote for the best!! Life is AMAZING here!! We've visited the greenest of national parks, went kayaking with dolphins through the red mangroves, hung out on the most stunning white sanded beaches, and seen alligators, panthers, birds and iguanas enjoying the perfect weather.\n\nIt's my first time in Florida since 2007, so it's great to be back with fresh eyes and new perspectives.

I am pretty much working from the time I wake up until I go to sleep. And the most challenging part is that I am only ONE person with ONE brain and ONE vision. I often make mistakes. \n\nSo if you could be so kind, I'd like to take a moment to ask YOU for your FEEDBACK. What do you like most about my videos? What do you hate?\n\nFeel free to rip me apart as much as you'd like-- the more honest you are, the better it is for me to improve in the future.\n\nThank you so much, and I'll see you tomorrow in PAPUA NEW GUINEA! \n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n\n► Subscribe for more travel videos: http://bit.ly/2hyQnZ1\n► Travel Blog: https://drewbinsky.com/\n\nFIND ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drewbinsky/ (I post daily videos there!)\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/drewbinsky/\nSnapchat @drewbinsky\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/drewbinsky\n\nMORE ABOUT ME:\nhttps://drewbinsky.com/about/\n\nCONTACT ME: \ndrew (at) drewbinsky (dot) com",

I did NOT expect what I saw today in Zion National Park - the 3rd most visited National Park in the USA behind the Great Smoky Mountains and the Grand Canyon. The natural red sandstone mountains, glowing emerald pools and fantastic hikes around Zion are some of the best landscapes I've seen anywhere on earth! \n\nHave you ever heard of Zion National Park? If not, please do yourself a favor and add it to your USA bucket list -- especially if you like hiking...

Beondegi is a common street food & snack, that was the most disgusting that I've ever eaten.  It's literally boiled silkworms! \n\nI've eaten lots of crazy things since I've been living in Korea, but this tops the list for the worst.  If you come to Korea, then you must try Beondegi!\n\nIf you can eat an entire serving of Beondegi in one sitting, then I will personally award you with a medal.  Have fun!",
