We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 9TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 the Earthroamer SX\n02:18 Outside tour\n09:59 Inside tour \n19:08 Skinning up the mountain \n23:01 Grilling dinner \n24:43 Polar plunge!!",

We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed.  So after 2 years of saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we rean out of money and went home to normal life. We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n#travel #travelvlog #vanlife",

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time.

This recipe will feed ~4 people, depending on how hungry they are ;) Have fun with it!\n\nLike I said in the video, my sister-in-law showed me this recipe, but here is the original!!: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaN3qsqXt38\n\nWhat you’ll need, in order: (I tweaked it from the OG a little bit)\n6-8 garlic cloves (depending on your taste ;))\n1 onion\n1 fresh ginger ~2 inches minced\n(+ any other vegetable you enjoy!)\nOlive oil\nTurmeric powder\nCurry powder\nRed Pepper Flakes\nSalt & pepper\n—\n2 cans of chickpeas\n1 can of coconut milk\n1 can of broth\n—\nBasamati rice\n1 bunch of greens\n1 bunch of fresh cilantro\n1 scoop of plain greek yogurt \n\n1. Chop garlic, onion, and ginger, and sauté them in olive oil with salt and pepper and sizzle until a little brown - maybe takes my tiny burner about 10 min. \n    1. Add in any other vegetables you’d like here! I have used sweet potatoes, regular potatoes, zucchini, bell pepper…there are no rules!\n2. While those are cooking, drain and rinse chickpeas.\n    1. Add them in with the ginger garlic mixture\n3. Stir everything up, and add in the turmeric, curry powder, more salt and pepper, and any other spice that tickles your fancy.\n    1. Let this cook for a few more minutes with with minimal stirring, browning chickpeas.\n    2. Once chickpeas are done, mash them up a little to help thicken the curry.\n4. Next, pour in the can of coconut milk. \n5. Right after that, fill that same coconut milk can up with the broth and pour. Or just buy a can of broth and use that, but it’s nice to have the bigger jug incase you want to add more later. Stir!\n6. This where I sprinkle in some red pepper flakes to add some heat!\n7. Bring to a small boil and just walk away! Let it alllll sizzle and thicken on medium heat until it’s to a nice thick consistency. Maybe 20 minutes.\n8. While it’s thickening, make the rice. \n9. Right before the curry is done, throw in some spinach, or whatever green you like. I actually think chopped kale is the best. Stir and let them cook in the soup for the last couple minutes. \n10. Once it’s ready, serve the curry over rice, and add the best parts on top:\n    1. 1 scoop of greek yogurt\n    2. A [giant handful of] chopped fresh cilantro\n    3. A shake of turmeric powder just because it’s pretty :)\n    4. Drizzle olive oil. Enjoy!",

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 \n\n#northpole #icebreaker #cruise #arcticcruise #travel #travelvlog \n\n00:00 Cruise around SVALBARD?!\n00:43 POLAR BEAR FINALLY\n02:38 First walrus colony\n03:12 ANOTHER POLAR BEAR\n04:20 Day 12 - first time stepping on land\n06:21 We love AG1!\n07:32 polar bear family!!!\n10:34 INSANE polar bear eating a seal\n13:15 Epic walrus beach\n14:00 16 days without internet\n15:14 Arctic kayaking\n19:00 Whales!\n22:11 Bloops",

We started “travel hacking” & finally decided we wanted to go travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling, and we didn’t want to stop after just one year! After achieving our new goal of 100 countries and then all 7 continents (check out our documentary here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s), we had no plans to slow down, until 2020 decided to force us to ;) which is when we bought a converted Sprinter van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 #penthouse #newyorkcity",

Chernobyl is one of the most interesting and eerie places we have ever been to. It almost feels like stepping back in time. 33 years after the disaster parts of Chernobyl are still highly radioactive, but you can still visit the exclusion zone if you go with a guide who knows the areas to avoid. \n\nYou can't visit Chernobyl without a tour guide, and we booked our tour through SoloEast.

(and for giving us 50% off our tickets!)\n\nEpisode 962 | Filmed May 2025\n\nSubscribe to our new friend  @jameswarrenolivertravelexpert  :)\n https://youtu.be/W92wnw7Ytq8?si=yj_Jm5asGT03YMJo \n\n——————————————————\n\nWho are Kara and Nate?! \n\n2016-2019: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuFv4iF8wgg&t=1s \n\n2020-2024: https://youtu.be/ikAN9e0gBaU?si=G644UGWIqPrOzTYW\n\nOriginally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married 2013 and were super “normal.” I was a teacher and Nate started a small printing business from the spare bedroom of our apartment. \n\nWe discovered the world of “travel hacking” while planning our honeymoon & became addicted ;)\n\nSo after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world.\n\nOur goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went back home to “normal life.” We started this channel to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with living on the road and found a new passion for capturing our travels through video. So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n00:00 what is Global Airlines?\n01:20 check in/lounge\n02:49 boarding A380 from the ground\n05:30 caviar party\n08:11 our Daily Drop SUMMER SALE!!\n11:35 meal service \n12:57 slammer time with the founder\n13:32 first class seat review \n14:48 how much does it cost to run an A380?\n18:27 bathroom tour/amenity kit ;)\n21:30 visiting upstairs business class\n22:56 addressing the negative reviews\n24:00 first class bed conversion\n24:54 final thoughts \n27:08 bloops :)",

Try it risk free ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160120.1 ⬅️\n\nLocation: A Sketchy Capsule Hotel in Tokyo, Japan\n\nStaying at a capsule hotel was one of the things I was looking forward to most when visiting Tokyo, Japan. Our experience staying at a capsule hotel was nothing like I expected it to be.\n\nPlease don't let this video stop you from staying at a capsule hotel next time you're in Tokyo! There are much nicer hotels, but messed up and went to the wrong capsule hotel! I found a nice one on Trip Advisor, but we put the wrong address into our maps and we ended up a super gross capsule hotel. We didn't realize we had checked into the wrong hotel until it was too late! \n\nTo stay at the capsule hotel you pay with a vending machine. We couldn't get our money back so we were stuck there for tonight. Unfortunately, they still allow smoking inside, so that didn't make our sleepless night any better. It was pretty much a nightmare experience, but we tried to make the most of it! \n\nIf you want to know what it's like to stay at a really gross capsule hotel in Tokyo, Japan check out this VLOG!\n\nThe capsules we stayed in were nothing like the capsules we saw in +Only In Tokyo's video - Tokyo Capsule Hotel Experience ★ WAO✦RYU!TV ONLY in JAPAN #26 東京カプセルホテル体験 - https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=capsule+hotel\n\nThey also weren't anything like the ones in Japan Online's video - Capsule Hotel in Tokyo, Japan - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkg-IaEkSi4\n\nThese look more more enjoyable!

More information on traveling through Kiwirrkurra country can be found at https://www.tjamutjamu.com/travelling-to-kiwirrkurra-country and https://kiwirrkurra.au/.

Halong Bay is a UNESCO World Heritage Site for a good reason. It is one of the most beautiful places we have ever seen! It’s filled with giant lime stone karsts that jut out of the water in every direction for miles.\n\nThe best way to experience the bay is by a luxury cruise. There are tons of cruise ship operators offering cruises through Halong Bay. The cruises range from cheap backpack boats to five start luxury cruise ships. Since visiting Halong Bay is most likely a once in a lifetime experience, we decided to splurge on a 5 star luxury cruise to ensure that we had the best experience possible!\n\nWe booked our cruise with Signature Cruise and we were elated with our experience. Seriously, we don’t have a bad thing to say about Signature Cruises, and that should mean a lot coming from me because when I splurge on an experience I am very critical. Also, the staff treated us like royalty! They made our experience even better.\n\nOur luxurious cruise through Halong Bay started with an amazing lunch served while we were cruising to a floating fishing village. After arriving at the floating village we were rowed around the village in a row boat by one of the women who lived in the floating village. After our row boat ride was completed, we visited a pearl farm to learn how pearls are made. To be completely honest, this sounded kind of lame to me when I read it on the itinerary, but it was actually really interesting!\n\nAfter leaving the pearl farm, we were taken back to the cruise ship. After an hour or so of relaxing and taking in the beautiful views of Halong Bay, we had a cooking class where we learned to make fresh spring rolls. After the cooking class we enjoyed happy hour with more beautiful views. After happy hour, a delicious five course dinner was served aboard the boat. After dinner I had the opportunity to try my hand at squid fishing. I got really lucky and managed to catch 10!\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to take a luxury cruise through Halong Bay check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

We discovered the world of “travel hacking” & became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time! Now you can find us on the road or in the air any given day. Just incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love, living on the road and making videos together 😊🎥🌎 #travel #travelcouple #travelvlog\n\n00:00 Meet our friends❤️\n00:52 Will we ever have kids?\n02:15 Why can’t Nate dance?\n02:59 How’d we all meet?\n03:29 Who is the messiest?\n05:00 Hardest thing about travel YouTubing?\n05:45 Who works harder?\n07:30 One thing we can’t travel without?\n08:09 Best digital shopping experience ;)\n09:12 Who can chug a glass of water the fastest?\n09:33 Nate’s income and expense reports?\n10:03 My least favorite question…\n10:38 Our group dynamic🥰\n11:39 Our unspoken travel rules\n12:25 Packing cubes???\n13:34 Our amazing cancer fighters💃🏼💘💃🏻\n14:27 Will we ever retire from YouTube?\n15:36 What are K&N like in real life? \n17:23 When did we feel comfortable with our YT income?\n17:59 How often are arguments cut out of vlogs? \n18:27 What do we do off camera?",

Thank you Soneva Fushi! https://www.soneva.com/soneva-fushi/#experiences Today we woke up in our dreamy villa and rode our bikes to the breakfast buffet on the beach. It was overwhelmingly delicious! Next our very own \"Mr. Friday\" gave us a tour of the whole island via golf cart. It ended at Soneva Fushi's private yacht where we jumped off 7 meters into the ocean! We then took a boat to our VERY OWN ISLAND! They packed us a cooler and a cell phone and left us on the most beautiful tiny island with only an umbrella and overwater hammock! It was raining and cloudy when they dropped us off, but thankfully it cleared up so we quickly frolicked along the beach and flew the drone, and it went by WAY too fast! Next, we grabbed a quick lunch which just happened to include a buffet of my favorite food - SUSHI! And then we ride 25 minutes via speedboat to a snorkeling spot with the island's marine biologist (YEP). It was the bluest, warmest, clearest water we've ever been in, and we saw sea turtles and huge sting rays! After that we got on ANOTHER boat for a dolphin sunset sail complete with champagne and gourmet snacks. We watched Spinner Dolphins play while the sun went down behind them, and IT WAS THE MOST MAGICAL DAY OF OUR LIVES :)\n\n✈️ @DailyDrop is our FREE travel newsletter!

So we did everything we could to keep going.\n\n4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time!\n\nAfter ~2 years of van life, we are back to full time international traveling! And now we are in our 10TH YEAR of finding the best adventures the world has to offer :) \n\nWe are incredibly grateful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 Thank you to everyone who has been a part of our journey!\n\n0:00 what in the world is this\n1:46 Day 1 - living with locals \n5:52 Cooking potatoes in poop\n14:57 Bridge making party begins\n16:43 drinking chicha with the locals\n19:32 insane handmade ropes\n25:30 We love Peru \n27:27 Day 2 - the fun continues\n32:52 Nate is one of the boys now\n36:48 I joined the dance team\n39:17 eating 9 year old potatoes\n40:28 Day 3 still bridging \n44:08 Nate is thriving\n51:56 Finally finishing in the dark\n57:03 we got to cross the bridge!!",

We found out by going to the biggest rivalry game on both continents: Real Madrid vs. Barcelona ⚽️ & Tennessee Vols vs. Florida Gators 🏈 The two experiences were WAY different than we expected! Which sport do you prefer?! Special thanks to Rocket Learn for sponsoring this episode! Check out the latest episode of Home Lore here: https://youtu.be/PpZmD_5Le0A \n\nWe grew up watching American Football and have always wanted to go to a \"soccer\" game (calling it soccer to prevent confusion ;)). \n\nThe Tennessee Vols and Florida Gators have been rival teams for awhile now, and Tennessee is actually good this year, so we thought that'd be a great game to go watch in real life.\n\nThen we learned that Real Madrid and Barcelona were going to be playing each other (AKA El Clasico!) WHILE we were in Spain! \n\nWe had the best time sharing game day at our alma mater, AND getting to experience our very first \"soccer\" game with our new friend Yoanna!\n\nAt the end of the day, even though these 2 sports are very different from each other, our favorite part was seeing people (and complete strangers) from all over the world at both events bonding, putting their differences aside, and having a great time together :) \n\nDid any of our comparisons surprise you?

It was totally worth it because it wasn't too hot yet and we took all the videos and photos we wanted with NO other people! Once the first tour bus arrived, we headed back to our hotel and had breakfast (AND COFFEE), but then decided to nap for few hours to wait out the mid day heat before heading to the Valley of the Kings via a $0.10 ferry and $7 taxi. Once again, we felt like there should have been way more tourists than there was, but we weren't complaining!\n\n✈️ @DailyDrop is our FREE travel newsletter!

Travel has a way of making you crave new experience, and eating a tarantula and scorpion was definitely a new experience from us.\n\nA few of the street food vendors in Cambodia have giant plates of bugs for sale. While we were there, we didn't see any other tourist eating the bugs, so when we decided to eat a scorpion and a tarantula, it drew a crowd.\n\nThe man selling the bugs warmed us up with a cricket. Then, we tried the scorpion. I tried to stop us there, but kara basically forced me to eat the spider!     \n\nIf you want to see our reactions to eating the bugs, check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

The streets are colorful and lively, and we tried some yummy street foods. The next day we cruised to Cartagena where we got to try Colombia’s most award winning coffee! We ended the day hanging out with celebrity chef Jorge Rausch in the ship’s kitchen to learn how he makes ceviche!

Try it risk free  ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160115 ⬅️\n\nSUMO WRESTLING Tournament | Tokyo, Japan\nLocation: Sumo Stadium - Tokyo, Japan\n\nWatching a sumo wrestling tournament was our most memorable experience from our trip to Tokyo! We spent an entire day watching the tournament. The rituals before an after each match are as much a part of the sumo experience as the wrestling itself. \n\nThe rituals get even more elaborate later in the day when the Makuuchi (Grand Sumo Champions) matches begin! There is an elaborate ceremony to introduce the Grand Sumo Champions, and the rituals before their matches are much longer.\n\nI was very surprised by the size difference in many of the wrestlers. There are not weight class in sumo wrestling. Also, the sumo wrestlers in the morning matches were much smaller than the better wrestlers who wrestle later in the day! \n\nIf you go to a sumo wrestling tournament at Ryogoku Kokugikan Stadium, expect it to be very empty during the morning matches. Don't worry, once the after noon wrestling matches begin, the crowd begins to poor in and the stadium becomes electric during the grand sumo matches.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to attend a Sumo Wrestling Tournament in Tokyo, Japan check out this VLOG!\n\nWe'd like to say thanks to +blackarmy81 who posted the following video that inspired us to visit a sumo wrestling match -  Sumo Wrestling 2014 05 21 Tokyo Japan - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCiJH...\n\nWe also have to give thanks to GuillaumeErard.com for their their inspiring video - Summer Grand Sumo Tournament Final Highlights (Tokyo - 20 May 2012) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRuQB...\n\nThanks for watching!

Honestly, I'm surprised after how much we've travelled that we haven't seen one before. It was a very scary experience to see, I can't imagine if it actually happened to us. It was in the middle of the day with people all around. The woman was not physically harmed, and we do not know if they ever caught the man who attacked her. It was a wake up call for us though, since we always walk around with a camera, phones, and bags. Dangerous happenings are everywhere and not just in Cape Town, so we are definitely going to be more cautious of our surroundings. \n--------------------- \nWe got settled in to our sweet as AirBnb apartment in the middle of Cape Town, then got lunch at Skinny Legs and some groceries for the week.

In this vlog you'll see two of Queenstown's most popular bungy jumps, the Nevis Bungy Jump and the Kawarau Bridge Bungy Jump. Both bungy jumps are owned by the AJ Hackett company. They are professionally run, and we felt safe and sound in their hands... sort of. At least as much as you can feel safe while bungee jumping!\n\nWe started off our morning in Queenstown with Jordan and Julianne jumping from Kawarau Bridge Bungy Jump. This jump is 43 meters high. It was the first bungy jump to be established in New Zealand. The scenery is absolutely beautiful, and you jump in to the turquoise water of the glacial river below! \n\nKara and I jumped from the Nevis Bungy Jump later that afternoon. The Nevis Bungy is 3 times taller than the Kawarau Bridge Bungy. For this jump you ride a little metal cart out to a small building that's hanging between two mountains. Then you jump from 134 meters above the ground. This is the tallest bungy jump in New Zealand and the 14th tallest in the world! \n\nIf you want to know what it's like to jump from the highest bungy jump in New Zealand check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

The food court in Chinatown is filled with a dizzying number of delicious food options. During this excursion we choose to try fried carrot cake, chili crab dumplings, and ice kacang also know as Malaysian shaved iced.\n\nAll the food we tried was amazing! Our trip to Chinatown was made even more exciting because the town was decorated for Chinese New Year. The streets where packed with people, but the atmosphere was fantastic. We would highly recommend visiting Chinatown during Chinese New Years.\n\nWe want to say a special thanks to Kyle Le Dot Net who inspired this food excursion to Chinatown with his video: eating at a Singapore FOOD COURT in CHINATOWN\n\nThis visit was also inspired by Phenomenal Travel Videos: Things To Do In Chinatown Singapore.\n\nThanks for watching!

If you’re planning a trip to Chiang Mai Thailand, make sure that you’re here on a Sunday Night. The market is HUGE, and full of tons of delicious food. \n\n\n\nThe night market literally stretches for almost 2km. We spent hours wandering the streets, and we still couldn’t see the end of the market when we gave up! This night market in Chiang Mai is better than any other night market we’ve been to in Thailand! \n\n\n\nThe Sunday Night Market had an amazing selection of local goods. Even though there are thousands of stalls that set up on Sunday nights in Chiang Mai, very few of them sell the same thing. A pleasant surprise after visiting the night markets of Bangkok.\n\n\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to visit the Chiang Mai Sunday Night Market, check out this VLOG!\n\n\n\nThanks for watching!

Before we started traveling, we never ate Indian food. Little did we know what we were missing out on. Little Indian in Singapore was the perfect place to experience authentic meal of Indian Food.\n\nWe ducked into a local Indian restaurant where we were the only tourist. We ordered some things that sounded kinda familiar, but when the food arrived, we realized we had to no clue how to properly eat Indian food.\n\nThe Indian man running the restaurant took us under his wing, and showed us how to eat with our hands. He was very picky about our form, which we both thought was funny. We learned how to properly push the food into our mouths using our thumbs.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like eating indian food in Singapore's Little India check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

Oslob Cebu is one of the best and most consistent places to swim with Whale Sharks. Since the fishermen of Oslob feed the whale sharks daily, they come back every day. If you pay for the snorkeling you are almost guaranteed to see whale sharks!\n\nOn the day that we went on the snorkeling tour there were nine whale sharks! We got to encounter four of these gentle giants while we were in the water!\n\nThe biggest draw back to the entire whale shark experience is the crowds of people. Since Oslob has become know as for this tourist attraction, hoards of people flock to the beach every morning to swim with the whale sharks.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to swim with a 25 foot whale shark, check out this video!\n\nWe'd like to say thanks to Just One Way Ticket for the inspiring video \"Snorkeling with Whale Sharks in Oslob Philippines [ GoPro Hero 3+ Black ]\" that lead us to Oslob!\n\nWe also have to give thanks to @GoPro and their inspiring video Gopro: whale shark dive in the Philippines\n\nThanks for watching!

We’ve been to a several first class lounges, but the Qantas First Class Lounge in Sydney stands apart from the rest. The food selection is the best we’ve ever seen in airline lounge. We loved that incorporated a seasonal foods into the dishes. \n\nAdditionally, the Qantas First Class Lounge is massive, so even though there were a lot of people in the lounge when we were there, it never felt crowded.\n\nThe highlight of the Qantas Lounge in Sydney is the spa. I had a twenty minute neck and shoulder massage, and it was the best massage I’ve had in my entire life. The spa inside the fist class lounge was voted the best spa in Sydney multiple years in a row.

Try it risk free  ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160222 ⬅️\n\nLocation: Angkor Wat, Siem Reap, Cambodia. \n\nThis morning we woke up at 4 a.m. to see the sunrise at Angkor Wat. It was OK... To be completely honest, I think there are much better ways to spend your morning exploring the Angkor Temple complex.\n\nSunrise at Angkor Wat is OVERRUN by tourist. Yes, we did contribute to the problem, but that's beside the point. When we showed up to Angkor Wat at 5 a.m. there were already TONS of people there. We weren't even able to get a seat on the far side of the pond. By the time the sun was rising, there were over 2,000 people watching the sunrise with us. The crowds were almost more impressive than the sunrise.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the sunrise over Angkor Wat is beautiful, but so is everything else at the Angkor Temple complex.

I could literally just walk around the old quarter for weeks without getting board. While walking around the old quarter in Hanoi you constantly have to dodge motor bikes! It really keeps you on your toes.\n\nYou never know what you're going to see when walking around the old quarter. One second you might see chickens playing in the road. The next minute you'll see hundreds of knock off Rolex watches. One thing that I guarantee you'll see TONS of stores selling cheap North Face apparel.\n\nApparently North Face apparel in Hanoi is cheap because the North Face factory is located in Vietnam? I don't know how true this is, but I do know that Kara scored a nice \"North Face\" puffy jacket for only $20 in the Old Quarter of Hanoi in a store called Made in Vietnam!\n\nIf you want to know what it's like visiting Hanoi's Old Quarter check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

We learned to do Thai Chi on the top of the cruise ship while we cruised past the beautiful karsts that fill Halong Bay. After our class we were served a light breakfast before getting on the smaller boat to visit a cave inside one of the limestone karsts.\n\nWe left for the cave at 7 a.m.. Thankfully, Signature Cruises makes it a point to get there early. By the time we had finished exploring the cave, a lot more cruise ships had showed up. The cave was packed with tourists! We were lucky to get to experience the cave with only a few other people there.\n\nAfter visiting the cave we had the opportunity to kayak back to the ship. We took the long way back and circled the island that held the cave. Being in a kayak so low to the water really helped us to appreciate the massive size of the limestone mountains that jut out of the water.\n\nAfter returning the ship, we were served a delicious brunch as we cruised back to the port. Sadly, shortly after finishing brunch we arrived back to the port where we had to disembark the cruise ship. It was sad saying bye to ship and the amazing staff. Our only regret is that we didn't book a longer cruise!\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to take a luxury cruise through Halong Bay check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

Neither one of us had ever had egg coffee or coconut coffee. We had no idea what we've been missing out on our whole lives! \n\nWe searched the city of Hanoi for at least an hour looking for a cafe that served egg coffee. We finally found a local cafe that served amazing egg coffee! We had no clue what to expect, but we didn't know how much the taste, flavor, and texture would blow us away! \n\nEgg coffee is like nothing we have ever had before! It's a raw egg that is whipped and added to vietnamese coffee. The result is the creamiest most delicious froth we have ever tasted! \n\nCoconut coffee is completely different, but we might have enjoyed it even more! It's basically a combination of a coconut smoothie, vietnamese coffee, and sweetened condensed milk. I think I would live in Vietnam just to drink this amazing coffee every morning! \n\nIf you want to know what it's like drinking Vietnamese coffee in the Old Quarter of Hanoi check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

The other first class lounge is the Cathay Pacific \"Wing First Class Lounge\". Last time we were at the HKG airport we spent most of our time at The Wing.\n\nThis time, we spent the majority of the time enjoying \"The Pier\". The Wing get a lot of recognition because of it's \"relaxation cabanas\" and champagne bar, but I think The Pier is a superior lounge!\n\nThe Pier offer a much wider menu at the sit-down restaurant, and you can get a free foot massage or back massage!

Try it risk free ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160206 ⬅️\n\nLocation: Temple Street Night Market, Hong Kong\n\nThe Temple Street Night Market is Hong Kong's biggest and best night market! Make sure to plan a trip to the night market on your next visit to Hong Kong! It's a great way to take in the culture of Hong Kong in and around the market. The market is four full blocks of street stalls selling everything from selfie sticks to hand painted Chinese fans. \n\nIf you're like us and mostly visit night markets for their food, I have bad new for you. None of the stalls in the night market serve food. The Temple Street is totally devoted to shopping. However, just a block away is the Ladies Market. This night market is know for selling fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats. If you prefer not to cook your own food, you can check out one of the many restaurants located on the streets adjacent to the Temple Street Night Market. Even if you're not into into shopping, we still highly recommend visiting the night market to get a feel for the streets of Hong Kong.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to visit the Temple Street Night Market check out this VLOG starting at 8:11!\n\nWe'd like to say thanks to @AndyandMeesh for their inspiration to visit to the Temple Street Night Market.

Try it risk free  ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160310.1 ⬅️\n\nThis adventure made possible by: http://www.elephantjunglesanctuary.com/\n\nVisiting an Elephant Sanctuary in Chiang Mai, Thailand was an unforgettable experience! We booked our day at the Elephant Sanctuary through the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary!\n\nWe opted to spend a full day at the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary so that we could spend as much time as possible interacting with the Elephants! We would gladly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Chiang Mai.\n\nWhen booking an elephant experience in Chiang Mai, Thailand, make sure to do your research about the elephants, and definitely don’t book a tour that includes riding the elephants! In order for the elephants to be tamed enough for humans to ride them, they must be put through brutal torture as baby. This allows the owners of the elephants to break their spirits until they become totally submissive to humans.\n\nPlease don’t support this type of business! Instead, support an elephant sanctuary or reserve such as the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary. The elephants are treated much better! Plus, it way more fun to feed and bathe the elephants that it is to ride them!\n\nWant to connect with the Elephant Jungle Sanctuary on Social Media?\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzpwQeyn3tsKnRTiAlC5BRg\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/elephantjunglesanctuary\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/elephantjunglesanctuary/\n\nThanks for watching!

Kara and I are both BIG Lord of the Rings and Hobbit fans so when we started to plan our trip to New Zealand we knew we wanted to visit Hobbiton! While RVing around New Zealand we stopped close to the town of Cambridge, New Zealand where the Hobbiton movie set is located. \n\nThe entire area around Hobbiton makes you feel like you're in the movies! Hobbiton is surround by green rolling hills dotted with sheep. We were lucky enough to camp only a few minutes away from the movie set. It literally felt like we were camping in the Hobbiton movie set! After staying the night only a couple minutes down the road, we woke up early to take one of the first tours around the Hobbiton movie set. We usually don't pay for tours like this… However, the tour around the Hobbiton movie set was totally worth it!! If you're on the North Island of New Zealand you should definitely take the time to take a tour around Hobbiton! \n\nIf you want to know what it's like to visit Hobbiton New Zealand check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

We didn't book our ticket for the overnight train ahead of time, so we when we arrived in Bangkok they only had 3rd class tickets available. It was impossible to sleep on the overnight train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai! \n\nBy the time we arrive in Chiang Mai, Thailand, we were exhausted. However, we pulled ourselves out of bed and quickly fell in love with city of Chiang Mai! Traveling from Koh Tao to Chiang Mai overland was rough, but it was totally worth it!\n\nOver land travel in Thailand is an experience in and of itself!\n\nThanks for watching!

Today we flew from Bangkok (BKK) to Hanoi (HAN) via Veit Jet.\n\nVeit Jet offered the cheapest price between Bangkok and Hanoi. I had read some bad reviews about the airline. However, I have to say that our trip from BKK was HAN was very enjoyable. Checkin at the Bangkok Airport was a breeze, and flight left and arrived on time.\n\nOnce we arrived at the Hanoi Airport, things didn't quite a smoothly. Immigration took at least two hours. Then we had trouble finding the public bus into the city center of Hanoi. However, we quickly forgot all of our problems when we were upgrade to a suite room at the Hilton Garden Inn Hanoi!\n\nIf you want to know what it's like flying from Bangkok to Hanoi check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

The mixture of intricate temple decorations, and the sheer scales of the caves make for breathtaking experience.\n\nIn order to get inside the caves you need to climb 272 stairs.

Try it risk free ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160312 ⬅️\n\nToday's adventure brought to you by: http://www.chiang-mai-cooking-school.com/\n\nYou can't visit Chiang Mai, Thailand without taking an authentic Thai cooking class! We had the opportunity to spend a full day at the Thai Secret Cooking School. Obviously we haven't been to every cooking school in Chiang Mai, but I can very confidently say the Thai Secret Cooking School is by far the best cooking school in Chiang Mai! \n\nThe day started with a trip to the local market to pick up ingredients that we would use during our cooking class. After that we took a short drive to the cooking school. The cooking is also an organic farm (and their lovely home!). So before we began our cooking class, we went out to the garden and picked ingredients like flowers and herbs to cook our delicious Thai food!\n\nDuring the cooking class, we chose to learn to cook pad thai, spring rolls, Penang curry paste,  Penang curry with pork, mango sticky rice, and other Thai dishes. May is the instructor that teaches the Thai cooking class. She has an awesome personality and makes everything so much fun! She definitely makes the experience even greater! \n\nIf you are visiting Chiang Mai, and you love food half as much as we do - Definitely go to a Thai cooking school. The Thai Secret Cooking School comes with our absolute highest recommendations! We had a blast!\n\nWant to connect with the Thai Secret School on Social Media?\n\nYoutube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_MCerIc4OuXbBa0uELvNxw\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/pages/Thai-Secret-Cooking-School/484111038268116?ref=hl\n\nThanks for watching!

However, we were still able to find some fun foods to eat.\n\nThe best thing about the night bazaar is that it's open every night. If you aren't in Chiang Mai on the weekend.

But so is every other day in the Galapagos Islands! Today we woke up on the Natural Paradise bright and early and took a boat ride around Punta Vicente Roca. We saw tons of animals in the water, on the rocks, and in the sky. Then we got to jump in and have the best snorkeling of our lives. We saw orca whales, sea lions, sea turtles, penguins, and much more!

Most of the street food that was had was absolutely delicious. However, the STINKY TOFU that we bought from a street was NOT. From the first day we visited Taipei, we could smell the stink from the stinky tofu wafting down the streets. There's not mistaking the pungent smell as it obtrusively enters your nostrils. \n\nWe had debated the entire trip whether or not we were brave enough to try the fermented tofu. On our last day in Taipei, I succeeded in convincing Kara to try stinky tofu with me! There seem to be a lot of locals who enjoy stinky tofu and consider it a local delicacy. However, our American taste buds did not. It tasted just as bad it smells!!!\n\nKara does an amazing job explaining what like. If you want to see what it's like to try stinky tofu on the streets of Taipei check out this VLOG starting around 8:28!\n\nWe'd like to say thanks to Mark Wiens for the inspiring video Stinky Tofu - Eating Smelly Tofu in China! - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylW94Ff_S0g \n\nWe also have to give thanks to Off the Great Wall and their video that let us know what to expect as Americans - New Yorkers Trying Stinky Tofu For The Very First Time - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxf5hmDhPLE\n\nThanks for watching!

So, we put together a travel guide with 9 things you must do on your first trip to Seoul - http://karaandnate.com/9-things-you-must-do-in-seoul/ \n\nThis ended up being one of our favorite days in Seoul! We squeezed so much into one day. First we visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's massive and you could get lost exploring all day. It's popular to rent traditional dresses and take pictures in front of the detailed buildings which makes it a really fun place to walk around. The changing of the guards is also a super entertaining show to watch! Next we visited the picturesque village of Bukchon Hanok! And finally ended the night eating traditional Korean Fried Chicken at the park where all the local teens pitch tents and hang out all night!\n\n✈️ @DailyDrop is our FREE travel newsletter!

If you're visiting Luang Prabang, Laos, you MUST take a day trip to the Kuang Si Waterfalls.\n\nIf you're comfortable on a motorbike, we'd highly recommend renting a motor bike and driving yourself to the waterfalls. It's a very beautiful drive! Once at the Kuang Si Waterfalls you can pay a small fee to park your bike and it will be safe and sound! \n\nThe waterfalls are separated into different levels. The falls get more beautiful with each level you ascend. The final waterfall is a huge 100+ foot waterfall. Most people stop on the bridge below to admire the falls. However, if you hike up the path beside the waterfall, and you're willing to \"break the rules\", you'll be rewarded with the amazing experience of sitting on the edge of the Kuang Si Falls!\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to motor bike to the Kuang Si Waterfall in Luang Prabang check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

Try it risk free ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160228 ⬅️\n\nYesterday we travel from Bangkok to Koh Tao by bus and ferry. The entire over land journey between Bangkok and Koh Tao took about 15 hours. We got on the bus in Bangkok around 6 p.m. and we arrived on the island of Koh Tao around 10 a.m. the next morning.\n\nThe entire journey cost us around $20 each... If you're looking for the cheapest way to get between Bangkok and Koh Tao, this is probably you best option. However, if you value you time, I would highly recommend flying from Bangkok and then taking the ferry to Koh Tao.\n\nOur journey included several random stops, including a random bus station in the middle of the night, getting dropped off in the middle road, and arriving at the ferry pier at 4 a.m.. It was definitely one of our hardest travel days.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to travel between bangkok and koh tao via bus and ferry, check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before Nate turns 30 (which is March 20, 2019)!

It tasted pretty good, but the menu said it was sticky rice topped with FAT so that stopped Kara from truly enjoying the food.\n\nWe read on a few websites that we should eat Xoi Xeo at Xoi Yen, so we decided to today while we were in the old quarter. We probably should have done a little bit more research... I think maybe we should have topped our Xoi Xeo with meat or beans or something.\n\nNext time we'll do more research before eating Xoi Xeo haha.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like eating Xoi Xeo in Hanoi's Old Quarter check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

Try it risk free ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160208 ⬅️\n\nLocation: Victoria Peak, Hong Kong\n\nVictoria Peak offers the best views of Hong Kong harbor! If you want to make sure you get the best views of Hong Kong, head to Victoria about a 2 hours before sunset. That will give you time to get up the mountain to enjoy the sunset as well as the neon lights lights of Hong Kong harbor that light up after dark!\n\nThere are several ways to get to the top of Victoria Peak. You can hike (up a TON of stairs), you can ride a local bus to the top, or you can take the peak tram. The Peak Tram is the most expensive way to get to the top of the mountain, but it's also the most expensive! We took the local bus to the top of Victoria, and we really enjoyed the views of Hong Kong Island on the way the to the top.\n\nThis sunset was actually captured from the Mcdonalds that's inside the mall on top of the Peak, and the views from the Harbor were captured from the Lion's Pavilion. \n\nIf you want to know what it's like to watch the sunset from the top of Victoria Peak in Hong Kong check out this VLOG!\n\nWe'd like to say thanks to Yellow Productions for the inspiring video - The Peak Hong Kong Travel Guide - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSe96h-Wouk\n\nWe also have to give thanks to Samuel & Audery and their inspiring video - Peak Tram Ride along with stunning views of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbor from The Peak (太平山) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py2n_4QyuQo\n\nThanks for watching!

This river cruise with Luang Say Cruises easily ranks in my top three experience of the entire trip. The northern Mekong river cruise starts on the Laos border city of Huay Xai. Crossing the border from Chiang Khong to Hauy Xi was extremely easy thanks to Luang Say Cruise's helpful staff that walked us through the entire process! \n\nWe boarded our luxury river boat around 9 a.m., and by 9:30 we were cruising down the Mekong River. After cruising down the river for a couple of hours, we were severed an amazing lunch buffet. After lunch we continued down stream until we got to a small village on the bank of the Mekong River. Our boat docked on the shore while we explored the village to learn how the local mountain people live.\n\nAfter visiting the village our luxury cruise continued down river until we arrived at the Luang Say Lodge. We spent the night in a beautiful bungalow that offered amazing views of the Mekong River. That night we were served an amazing dinner, and the next morning we woke up to awesome views of the misty Mekong River.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to go on a luxury cruise down the Mekong River check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

Try it risk free ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160313 ⬅️\n\nLocation: Bua Thong Waterfalls (Sticky Waterfalls) - Chiang Mai, Thailand\n\nWe rented motor bikes and took about a two hour drive out of the city to some really cool waterfalls! They are called the Bua Thong \nWaterfalls aka “Sticky Waterfalls.” They get their name because of mineral in the water allows you to walk on the rocks without falling!\n\nDriving to the Bua Thong Waterfalls is quite the haul. It us over two hours to get there. However, I do think the drive is worth it. You literally feel like spiderman climbing up the sticky waterfalls.\n\nIt's such a weird feeling for a waterfall to be \"sticky\" it messes with your mind because you think you're going to slip, but you can just climb right up the waterfall. As far as I know, the Bua Thong waterfalls are the only waterfalls in the world that have this sticky feature.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to visit the Sticky Waterfalls in Chiang Mai, Thailand check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

Try it risk free ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160318 ⬅️\n\nLocation: Luang Prabang Night Market\n\nThe Luang Prabang Night Market is one of the most unique night markets in Southeast Asia. The night market is completely covered in in red and blue tents. The market is beautiful from above. As the sunsets the lights begin to come on, and the night market takes on a magical glow. \n\nThe Luang Prabang Night Market sells all kinds of local goods. Unlike other Southeast Asian countries. The market isn't filled with knock off goods. I didn't see a single pair of RayBans for sale. Instead the vendors were selling hand made jewelry and rice whisky with scorpions! \n\nIn comparison to other Southeast Asian countries, the night market is much smaller and the vendors are much less pushy. You could walk through the night market in about an hour, and only get hounded to buy things a couple of times.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to visit the Luang Prabang Night Market check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

Our advanced diving certification cost approximately $250 USD. We had an amazing experience diving in Koh Tao and we would highly recommend to anyone!\n\nThe only draw back to the diving was that the visibility was pretty poor.

We got up before the sun rise and headed back into the Dubai Desert where we went on our first HOT AIR BALLOON RIDE! It totally exceeded our expectations. We got to watch the sun rise over the dunes and even saw oryxes and camels trotting through the desert. It was magical! Once we landed we went back to the same Desert Camp as the night before for a delicious breakfast! We are continually impressed with the food quality in the middle of the desert ;) We were back at our hotel super early, so we rested and caught up on work before heading downtown for what every tourist must see - the tallest building in the world (Burj Khalifa) and the light show, but unfortunately they were both cancelled.

First we took a bus from Chiang Mai to Chiang Rai. This journey took about three and half hours. We left from the Chiang Mai bus terminal at 11:30 via the green bus company.\n\nAfter arriving in Chiang Rai we quickly boarded a local bus that would take us the rest of the way to Chiang Khong. The local bus from Chiang Rai to Chiang Khong took about two hours, and there was no A/C on the bus. It was a hot ride, but also a very beautiful ride because we got to see the rural country side of Thailand.\n\nAfter arriving in Chiang Khong, we caught a tuk tuk to our guest house. The journey from Chiang Mai to Chiang Khong was more pleasant than expected. Anytime we have to ride on buses all day, I always prepare myself for the worst. However, I would recommend going overland between these two cities to anyone.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like getting from Chiang Mai to Chiang Khong via bus check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

Try it risk free  ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160319 ⬅️\n\nLocation: Luang Prabang, Loas \n\nThe alms ceremony is a beautiful tradition that has been spoiled by tourists. Everyone jostles to get the best picture of the monks. As one person moves in closer, so do the rest. The next thing you know, people are standing two feet away from the monks during the alms ceremony.\n\nI believe at one point in the time, the alm ceremony in Luang Prabang was a beautiful ceremony, but sadly it's now turned into more of a tourist spectacle. \n\nEven though we've been extremely negative of the giving of the alms ceremony up until this point, I do believe it's worth the trip. If you're going to be in Luang Prabang, don't skip the alms ceremony. However, mentally prepare yourself ahead of time for the rude tourists you encounter. I believe that you can go to the alms ceremony without contributing to the problem. Just stay on the opposite side of the street and sit respectfully as the monks walk by. The rude tourist are going to show up anyway. You might as well at least get a glimpse of the monks collecting their alms.\n\nIf you want to know what it's really like to go to the Luang Prabang Alms Ceremony, check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

We started traveling full-time January 10, 2016. While daily vlogging was not the original plan, we were having way too many cool experiences not to share every single day! Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before Nate turns 30 (which is March 20, 2019)! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)\n\nWe’ve pulled inspiration from several of our favorite travel vloggers on YouTube, such as: +Casey Neistat +FunForLouis +Jon Olsson +Mr Ben Brown, and any other talented travel vloggers that YouTube’s algorithm will hopefully connect us with ;)",

First you start with a Tim Tam which is a traditional New Zealand Biscuit. They're amazing to begin with but even more amazing when you combine them with coffee in act known as the Tim Tam Slam.\n\nThe Tim Tam Slam starts by biting off opposing ends of the the Tim Tam. Then you insert one of the Tim Tam into the coffee and you suck the coffee through the other end of the Tim Tam. As soon as the coffee hits your tongue you slam Tim Tam into your mouth! Let's just say it's magical!\n\nThen we went to the powerful Huka Falls, and then to our new campground in Rotorua. We give a tour of our camper and then explore some of the geothermal activity in the area!\n\nIf you want to see how to properly do a Tim Tam Slam check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

This river cruise with Luang Say Cruises easily ranks in my top three experiences of the entire trip. The northern Mekong river cruise starts on the Laos border city of Huay Xai. Crossing the border from Chiang Khong to Hauy Xi was extremely easy thanks to Luang Say Cruise's helpful staff that walked us through the entire process! \n\nDay 2 of our luxury river cruise down the Mekong River cruise started at the Luang Say Lodge. Early in the morning I opened the windows of my bungalow to reveal a foggy, but beautiful view of the Mekong River. Next, we had a delicious breakfast. Then, we board our luxury river boat to continue cruising down the Mekong River.\n\nA couples hours into our journey down stream we stopped a local village to see how they made silk scarves and rice whiskey. After visiting the village we were served a delicious lunch on the boat. After lunch we stopped at a really neat cave on the side of the river. The cave was covered in buddha statues.\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to go on a luxury cruise down the Mekong River check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

Doi Suthep is set up on top of a mountain. It's an easy 30 minute motorbike ride outside of the city. We highly recommend renting a motor bike to drive to the Doi Suthep Temple because the roads are really curvy and a lot of fun on a bike.\n\nDo Suthep is a great day trip, especially if you continue on to the mountain village and coffee plantation. If you want to visit all three in the same day, it will take 6 - 8 hours. However, I believe this is one of the best day trips in Chiang Mai! \n\nChiang Mai is an amazing city, but a day trip outside of the city will give you an even greater appreciation for the city. Chiang Mai is quickly becoming our favorite city in Thailand! Next up, a day trip to the sticky waterfall! \n\nThanks for watching!

Try it risk free ➡️  https://faredrop.app/ytd_160324 ⬅️\n\nGoing overland from Luang Prabang to Vientiane then to Bangkok is an EXHAUSTING journey! Thankful we survived the back to back overnight bus and train combo. We started in Luang Prabang. There we boarded a \"VIP\" sleeper bus to Vientiane. The ride to Vientiane took about 10 hours. However, it was a rough 10 hours. The roads between Luang Prabang and Vientiane are winding mountain roads. We slide back an forth in our seats the entire time.\n\nWe arrived in Vientiane around 5 a.m.. We were dropped off at a bus station a little ways outside of the city. We caught a \"taxi\" into the city and wasted the day at a coffee shop. We were picked up at 3 p.m. for our overnight train between Vientiane and Bangkok.\n\nThe overnight train from Vientiane to Bangkok took a total 14 hours. The ride wasn't bad at all! Make sure you at least book the second class sleeper car. I wouldn't suggest that my worst enemy ride the bus from Luang Prabang to Vientiane. However, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the overnight from Vientiane to Bangkok to a friend!\n\nIf you want to know what it's like traveling overland from Luang Prabang to Bangkok check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling.

Obviously, Kara and I haven't been to every Rooftop bar in Bangkok, so we can't say for sure that the Octave Rooftop Lounge & Bar is the best. However, we can highly recommend it!\n\nI had done a ton of research about which rooftop bar to visit in Bangkok. I was originally inspired by the Hangover movie, which I'm sure most are familiar with. I had originally wanted to go to the rooftop bar where the Hangover was filmed. However, I learned that it's crazy expensive and over-crowded. That seemed to be the problem with many of the roof top bars in the city. \n\nThe Octave roof top bar was perfect. It offered amazing views of the city of Bangkok, it wasn't over crowded, and the drinks were a reasonable price.\n\nThanks for watching!

We started “travel hacking” and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before 2020! We are incredibly thankful to do something we love every day. :)",

Unfortunately, the amount of rude tourists that attend the alms ceremony can completely ruin the experience. After a frustrating experience a couple days ago, Nate woke up early again in search of Luang Prabang's authentic alms ceremony. \n\nGetting away from the main street completely transformed the experience! The alms ceremony on the main road feels more like a monk parade for the tourist. However, if you visit some of the side streets of Luang Prabang, you can still find some locals participating in the alms ceremony, and you'll avoid the hoards of tourists!\n\nIf you want to know what it's like to see an authentic Luang Prabang Alms Ceremony, check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

However, a lot of the hot springs in New Zealand cost $30 to visit. We didn’t exactly want to pay $30 to watch water boil so we explored two free hot springs options in Rotorua New Zealand.\n\nFirst we dug our own natural hot spring on the shore of lake Rotorua. Digging your own natural hot spring is one of those things that sounds way better than it is in real life. You’ll just have to watch the video to see!\n\nNext we visited free local park with tons of natural hot springs and geothermal activity. That was plenty for us, but if you want see a geyser unfortunately you’ll have to pay to visit Hell’s Gate or one of the paid geothermal parks in Rotorua New Zealand. \n\nIf you want to know what it's like visit free hot springs in Rotorua New Zealand check out this VLOG!\n\nThanks for watching!

Then we visited a turtle breeding center where we saw everything from tiny baby tortoises and mating mom and dads! On this island of Isabella, too many introduced animals have endangered this species of tortoises by eating the eggs and babies. Thanks to this breeding center, they are being raised until they are 5 years old and then released throughout the Galapagos Islands to mate naturally. It was another great day aboard the Natural Paradise :)\n\n✈️ @DailyDrop is our FREE travel newsletter!

We started “travel hacking” and taking more trips together and finally decided we wanted to travel for one year. After 2 years of saving $ and travel hacking over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left January 10, 2016. We started this YouTube channel to share our experiences with friends and family, then decided we really liked vlogging and traveling. So we extended our 1 year trip to THREE years :) Now we have a goal of traveling to 100 countries before Nate turns 30 (which is March 20, 2019)!

Here's the official definition according to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:\n\nThe Carnival of Oruro is a religious festival dating back more than 200 years that takes place in Oruro, Bolivia. It is one of UNESCO's Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Originally an indigenous festival, the celebration later was transformed to incorporate a Christian ritual around the Virgin of Candelaria (Virgin of Socavón), which takes place on March 2. The traditional Llama llama or Diablada became the leading traditional dance of the festival. Throughout the festival, more than 48 groups of folk dancers specializing in 18 different folk dances perform a pilgrimage to the Shrine of the Tunnel every Saturday of the carnival in a traditional parade. \n\nLearn more about becoming a Patron!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/karaandnate\n\nUPDATED CAMERA GEAR LIST:\nhttp://karaandnate.com/vlogging-gear/\n\nGET $35 OFF YOUR FIRST AIRBNB STAY:\nhttps://www.airbnb.com/c/karab49\n\n***TRAVEL VLOG 324***\nSong by Andrew Applepie: Flic En Flac\n http://andrewapplepie.com | http://youtube.com/andrewapplepie\n\nOriginally from Nashville, Tennessee, we got married June 2013 and quickly caught the travel bug!
