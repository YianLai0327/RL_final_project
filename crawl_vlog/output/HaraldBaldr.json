Seeing as Nepal is right next doors, expectations were thus sky high as far as the local food is concerned. The hotel I'm staying didn't do much to put a dampener on said expectations either when the receptionist stated upon check-in that; Nepalese cuisine is identical to that of India.\n\nYaay! This was going to be swell I thought. So I ordered a Butter Chicken to my room right then and there. I ate it but wasn't impressed. So out I ventured to try the restaurants. I walked into one of the most highly rated on Tripadvisor and whilst not horrible, I wasn't impressed. \n\nI therefore decided to go for the Nepalese street food options. However Saturday being a holiday here, the once that caught my attention were all closed. So it wasn't before today (which is Sunday) that I finally was able to try some authentic dirt cheap Nepalese street food. \n\nI decided to go for two dishes. The first, Chow Mein. Whilst not quintessentially Nepalese (it's not) I was highly impressed. So impressed in fact that I decided to go for another dish this street food stall had on offer: Samosa! But which was better? The Chow mein or the Samosa?\n\n■ Liking the videos you watch help increase their reach on YouTube 🙏\n■ NEW INSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/TheNorthmanReturns",

        "description": "■ INDIA, AHMEDABAD: After the epic hospitality this Indian family you see in the thumbnail showed me whilst touring their home in one of Ahmedabad's roughest neighborhoods, there was never really any doubt as to whether I was going to give them a little token of my appreciation. The only question was how much?\n\nWhilst eating dinner with them I had roughly $150 on me but decided to not hand over a single dollar. I know how people around the world and especially in Asia feel when it comes to these things. They don't act hospitable because they expect a reward but because of their belief in humanity. Handing over any sum upon my first visit would thus likely be construed as an insult regardless of how sorely it was needed. So I decided to walk out with the intention of coming back with a much larger sum.\n\nI had not yet spent February's Patreon money (the money donated to me by Patreons from around the world which is all earmarked for giving to others I run into on my travels). This family was as worthy a candidate as I think I'll ever run into. \n\nSo after a brief trip back to my hotel room to get my credit card, off I went to the bank....",

Several dishes and medicinal soups were cooked and devoured today.

It's a means of facilitating trade and it's also a store of value. The Masai tribes therefore go to great lengths to keep their herds well feed and healthy. Said task is the men's job. The women do basically everything else.\n\nAround 9AM everyday most of the men in the tribe wander out to find the best grassing fields for their herds. They stay with them all day and don't return until sunset roughly 10 hours later.\n\nThis morning I joined them for the very first leg of said journey as I was eager to visit a family of Swahili sharecroppers who'd built a make-shift scrapyard style tent in a cornfield they were tending to on the route the Masai wander out on.\n\nWe'd stopped there the day before to fry up some corn-cobs but discovered that not only maize was growing in their field.....\n\n Liking the videos you watch help increase their reach on YouTube 🙏\n■ NEW INSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/TheNorthmanReturns",

But the many peoples that call these mountains home; Sherpas, Tamangs and Tibetans just to name a few, have adapted fairly well. The ox looking animal known as the Yak is key to their adaption. \n\nYak bulls and cows gives these mountain dwelling people milk, fur, meat, insulation, cement and also fuel! Yes, you heard right. Yak dung is used as fire-wood; fueling stoves and warm meals in communities living way above the tree-line.\n\nKyanjin Gumpa, which sits at 4000m above sea level at the end of Nepal's Langtang valley, actually do have a little forest growing on a mountain nearby. Exactly how, given that the mountainside the town is built on is completely treeless, I never got a proper answer to. I did notice some small streams coming down the mountain the forest grows on though, meaning it's probably perpetually naturally irrigated. \n\nThe people living in Kyanjin Gumpa hence don't have to solely rely on Yak dung for all their heat and cooking needs. But they do use it to supplement their fires, which regardless of which fuel is being burnt, are incredibly labor intensive to maintain.\n\nJust how labor intensive exactly?

        "description": "■ KATHMANDU, NEPAL: Over 3 years ago, upon my first visit to Nepal, I ran into Sunil, who grew up in Nepal but is now living in America. He'd returned to help fund cancer treatment for kids whose families could not afford it. Fast forward to today, and his foundation has now helped over 122 Nepalis get treatment. Many have survived!\n\nOne of the first people he helped was a guy called Pradip. He now lives on a mountain which is about a days journey from Kathmandu. Rather than take a bus or motorbike I thought it would be more interesting to buy a bicycle and journey up there on my own to visit him and his family to congratulate him on surviving cancer.\n\nBut since I obviously don't fly around the world with a bicycle in my backpack, I first had to buy and actual bike. The first bike I looked at was one used by a hotel to cycle laundry back and forth. It was a classic timeless cycle but would've been very hard to navigate through the Kathmandu traffic on. \n\nMy search for a bicycle continued.... Down the road I saw a man deliver water bottles to shops. The bike was perfect but the owner seemed quite emotionally attached to his ride. There was only one solution: The Federales Reservos had to be rapidly deployed.\n\nWith a bicycle finally secured, and my Federal Reserves somewhat depleted, I started cycling at 7AM the next morning on the dusty streets of Kathmandu, through the historic town of Bhaktapur and ultimately up the foothills of the Himalayas.\n\nWhat I thought would be a leisurely, yet exhausting bike ride, turned out to be anything but just that. Instead this bicycle adventure from Nepal's capital Kathmandu turned out to be one of the greatest adventures I've had in recent years.....",

        "description": "■ NEPAL, HIMALAYA: Ever since I'd ran into an Indian trekker coming back down along the Langtang river on my first day of this Himalayan excursion, I've had one thing on my mind: get to Tibet Guesthouse at Lama Hotel rest-stop and try their Gongo (or Roksi as it's called in Nepal).\n\nI always like to sample locally made brews when I'm in a new country and according to this Indian who had just spent the previous night at Tibet Hotel, the owner there had made the best Gongo he'd ever had in his entire life.\n\nIn fact, and I quote: \"He has brewed it to perfection!\", he said.\n\nThat's why I set out from Bamboo Lodge so early in the morning without even eating anything other than a granola bar. I wanted to get to Tibet Guesthouse as soon as possible to start the day like any real man should: with a fresh shot of Gongo!\n\nWhat I didn't expect though was to run into the coolest and nicest couple I met on my whole Himalayan trekking adventure. A couple that started the very first lodge at the Hotel Lama location over 40 years ago and are still running that same guesthouse today.\n\n■ Now before you watch, or after for that matter, I'd like to comment on what you see in the very beginning here, which I actually fully understand given the hard times hotel and guesthouse operators face, but still rubs me the wrong way. As I'm walking into this area here called Lama hotel I already knew where I was going: Tibet Guesthouse. \n\nEvery-time I entered a cluster of guesthouses like this, the people who run the first hotels and restaurants will of course be outside trying their best get you to stop at theirs. In this case however I knew where I was going and clearly stated I was going to Tibet Guesthouse, although I didn't know exactly which building that was. \n\nInstead of simply pointing it out for me, they answer evasively on all my questions and instead say something along the lines of why don't I stop at their hotel instead.\n\nNormally I am fairly good and ignoring such people but in this case I was so obsessed with hunting for Gongo that they nearly got the better of me. Especially when I saw that big barrel of I almost set up shop there and as you can see for the next 5 minutes even after getting away, seriously pondered going back to eat at said hotel. \n\nLuckily I came to my senses and both drank and ate at Tibet Guesthouse which was the original plan. My point is when someone already know where they're going I wish they'd simply say sure... that's the hotel you see 3 buildings down there on the right; enjoy! \n\n■ LIKES NEWS: Free Gongo in the afterlife for anyone who clicks 'LIKE' on this video!

        "description": "■ BRAZIL, RIO DE JANEIRO: I've always preferred markets and street food over restaurants and modern shopping malls. The price is better, you're outside and you get served instantly without a wait. But what does it take to operate as a street vendor? Who are the entrepreneurs who go through the hassle of having to wheel a business into the desired location day after day, year after year? And what is it like to be an entrepreneur in a bureaucratic mess of a country like Brazil where there are more rules, laws and regulations on the books than citizens?\n\nA couple of days ago I was introduced to Oberdan Santos by a mutual friend of ours. Mr Santos is an entrepreneur, father and volunteer at his local church, who a little under two years ago, left his hometown of Manaus to live in one of Rio De Janeiro's many favelas looking to improve his plight and job opportunities. \n\nHe started selling food and candy for established street vendors as he had done back in his hometown Manaus but quickly excelled to the point where he decided to start for himself selling Acai, an ice-cream type of snack popular where he was born.\n\nAs soon as he told his story I asked if I could tag along the following day to document his daily life as an entrepreneur on one of Rio's most famous beaches: Leblond. \n\nThis video shows everything that transpired on said day....\n\nMore vids from this part of Rio:\n■ THE FAVELA BARBER OF ROCINHA: https://youtu.be/P9umScD5khI \n\n■ Santos' instagram: amazonas.acai\n■ Liking the videos you watch help increase their reach on YouTube 🙏\n■ NEW INSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/TheNorthmanReturns",

Needless to say, that's something I shouldn't have done. . . for nothing could have prepared me for the disaster that showed up when room service came knocking at my door! This was hands down the worst pizza I've ever had!",

        "description": "■ SRI LANKA, GALLE: Since that first day when I went to the fish market with the hotel chef I'd been curious if it was possible to join the fishermen on a trip out at sea. A couple of days later whilst enjoying a Carlsberg on the beach a an opportunity to do just that presented itself.\n\nA boat with a crew of lobster fishermen just came back from a day out at sea. Some of them joined me for a beer and although we had zero words in common I was able to make them understand that I'd love to join them on a dive for lobsters the following day.\n\nThey seemed to understand but just to make sure I brought a local driver down to the beach to ask if I could truly join. The answer was in the affirmative.\n\nSo at 6 o'clock before the sun was even up I rocked up on black rock beach as the locals call it, to begin my new career as a Sri Lankan fisherman or Lobster diver to be precise. Little did I know that a few hours later I'd earned the title of the nation's least seaworthy fisherman of all time... 🤦‍♂️🤣\n\n■ For more frequent updates from the road: https://www.instagram.com/heraldobaldieri/",

Well, you be the judge. I enjoyed them both.\n\nIf you find yourself in Las Vegas and in need of either a Haircut or a shave, you can find 'The Barber Shop: Cuts & Cocktails' on the famous Las Vegas strip on the ground floor of the Cosmopolitan Luxury Hotel.

They continue to be a mountain dwelling people at heart and whenever I asked anyone about moving to a warmer city where life is presumably easier, the answer was: NO!\n\nHaving been brought here by Kartok Lama, the woman who runs Hard Rock Cafe up here in these mountains you saw in my previous video, I was told I could spend the night to experience and get a unique insight into Tibetan village life in the Himalayas.\n\nNaturally this was an opportunity I was obviously not going to miss....\n\n■ If you wish to contact Kartok Lama and visit her Hard Rock Cafe in Himalaya's Langtang mountain range or her village, you can call her on: 984 988 1673 If you need a guide to take you up here, her sister's son can be reached on Instagram: go_himalaya\n\n■ NEWS: One free rice beer on location in Mundu village for everyone who LIKES this video 🙏\n\n■ NEW INSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/TheNorthmanReturns",

It's not like these classic bicycles are sold in stores anymore.\n\nSo I went for a walk with Polo School in search of someone willing to sell me theirs.

I've also never seen anything in this price range either away from both a beach and a major city.

The skin of the cow is literally on the ground next to the bonfire.\n\nThe main objective with this tribal market shopping spree was to get myself a more comfortable Masai outfit to wear in my village and to purchase a premium sized goat so the whole tribe could get some much needed proteins in their diet for at least one day. Since all they eat is Ugali, a mixture of Maize and water, with some leaves added into the mix, everyone were really excited when I told them about my goat BBQ plans.\n\nSo off went in search of the fattest goat in sight... my plans however were quickly, albeit only temporarily, scuttled when I spotted the hottest goat I've seen since Don Jr. My prized albino pet goat 🐐",

One of these is the ancient Kingdom of Mustang which dates back all the way to 1380 and wasn't fully merged into Nepal politically speaking before 2008.\n\nAlthough it doesn't technically exist as a sovereign state anymore, and it's capital Lo Manthang was in Upper Mustang, it's borders extended past the little town of Marpha, whose ancient Thakali culture is very much alive today. Religion, customs, architecture and food have been remarkably well kept alive here in all its glory.\n\nSome of the buildings in Marpha, although of modest construction, contain materials that are 400 years old. The city is also home to a Tibetan community which adds to the history on full display here. \n\nAll this is of course absolutely fantastic as international travellers are able to get a peak back in time as to what life, culture and architecture was like in the Forbidden Kingdom of Mustang hundreds of years ago.... and that was indeed my goal as I boarded my 14 seater airplane in Phokara bound for Jomsom. \n\nThe Himalayan Gongo Brewmaster 🏔️\n■ https://youtu.be/x0eCQWrmly4\n\nWrong Turn Manaslu 🏔️\n■ https://youtu.be/NCnxszyevzs\n\nLandslide Disaster Trek Himalaya 🏔️\n■ https://youtu.be/tXHM29QRMd0\n\nDanger on Mount Gongo 🏔️\n■ https://youtu.be/FaEd7Vo_9M8\n\nSurviving Himalaya 🏔️\n■ https://youtu.be/kJEA79OdefM\n\nWrong Turn Himalaya 🏔️\n■ https://youtu.be/mBM2tdrp0J0",

        "description": "■ TANZANIA, ZANZIBAR: Before leaving Zanzibar almost 2 months ago, I learnt that the World Gongo Hunting Champion of 2021; Mr. Faki Party Taxi, did not actually own a motorbike. The ones he'd been driving me around on were rented from others.\n\nThis is common on Zanzibar. The Rickshaw drivers I've spoken to also do this. Not one of them have said he owns his vehicle. Instead they rent them for 15 000 Tanzanian shilling per day. They spend another 15 000 on gasoline. Anything above 30 000 is thus profits.\n\nAfter confirming that Faki was also doing this, by having the bartender call him to ask about where he had bought his motorbike, I tried to find a motorbike dealer. But that's easier said than done in Zanzibar. Type motorbike dealer into Google maps and you get some results, but when you go to those shops not a single one of them actually have motorbikes for sale. \n\nI hence gave up and decided to enlist Faki himself for help. Surely he'd know where to buy one. I thus had my friend call him up again to tell Faki that I wanted to buy a motorbike for myself so as to keep it a surprise (that it was actually for him). The next day he drove to my hotel and said there was a shop that had TVS motorbikes for sale. So off we went....\n\nOTHER EPISODES WITH FAKI PARTY\n■ Gongo Hunt: https://youtu.be/Oo6pQQpVnSw\n■ No, SH%T: https://youtu.be/uPIY8WpXkVQ\n\n■ Thank you SO MUCH everyone who watched this series from Tanzania and a special THANK YOU to everyone who helped out with Emi's fundraiser.

Over one million bikers from all over the United States ride to this little town for a week long party every August. \n\nNaturally the sleepy little town swells into a booming marketplace for all kinds of businesses selling interesting t-shirts, unique motorbikes and even weapons. This was a roadtrip slash party slash shopping opportunity I did not want to miss!\n\nTo be honest I'd never heard of this annual motorbike rally in Sturgis before it was being slandered in a major Norwegian newspaper that very same week as a horrible Mexican beer plague spreading event! Since most things the media says is bad, is generally quite awesome,  I pitched the idea of driving there to Sunil who immediately said: YES LET'S GO THERE!!!\n\nHe has been watching videos from this event on YouTube for years and has always dreamt of going to see the unique motorcycles on show and for sale.

The distances between tourist attractions are short and the country is full of incredible characters who make you feel welcome at not only your local Daru shop but upscale hotels as well.\n\n I therefore decided to kick-off the 2020 travel season by checking in to a luxury 5 star hotel in the old Dutch fort city of Galle.\n\nAfter an absolutely horrendous flight where I was squeezed in next to two mega amazonian babushkas from Poland, I needed a serious deep sleep to recover. I therefore decided to splurge on the most luxurious hotel I could find.\n\nMy choice fell on Le Grand Galle, roughly 3 hours by car from the airport north of Colombo.

        "description": "■ OAXACA, MEXICO: Traveling anywhere in 2020 and 2021 was ridiculously expensive, difficult, time consuming and headache inducing. Sadly 2022 is even worse. Not only do the ubiquitous problems of arbitrary government travel restrictions still exist in most parts of the world... but inflation have been wreaking havoc on anything travel related which have resulted in a doubling and sometimes even trippling in prices on airfares and hotels.\n\nHaving not been to Mexico for exactly two years, I was anxious to see if that was also the case here. Mexico was far from a budget place when I last visited, but it was still a lot freer in 2020 than many other countries as far as traveling to the country was concerned.\n\nWith the famous Day of the Dead fast approaching I decided to pay Mexico a visit. I took trains, buses and taxis for several days before I found myself in a country with a direct flight to Mexico City. \n\nWhilst at Heathrow in London waiting for my flight with Aero Mexico I started looking at hotels. I was shocked!!!\n\nHotels that are normally US$ 20 a night were now going for $2-400! The upscale hotels that normally go for $200 were $1200!!!\n\nI decided to board my flight and book something upon arrival. After an 11 hour flight to Mexico City I sat down at 5AM in an airport restaurant to see if prices had improved. They had not!\n\nIt was time for plan B, choose another city to go to. After browsing around in Google Maps my choice fell on Oaxaca. Many people all over Mexico on my previous visits told me to travel to Oaxaca for a truly authentic Mexico experience.\n\nPlus I am always interested in visiting new cities I have never been before. Once the choice was made I went to SkyScanner to see if there were any direct flights from Mexico City to Oaxaca. There were but the cheapest was US $350 one way! That's an outrage!!!\n\nI asked the waitress in the restaurant and she said Oaxaca. was reachable in a day by bus. So off I went to find a bus to Oaxaca ASAP....\n\n■ OAXACA MARKET HUNT: https://youtu.be/WCVfjiWxQgk\n\n■ By clicking 'Like' 👍🏻 on this video you help me out massively with reaching both current subscribers and new viewers.

        "description": "■ LELYSTAD, NETHERLANDS: In the year 1628, the Dutch Merchant ship Batavia, named after the Germanic tribe the Romans called Batavians who inhabited the lands we today call Netherlands, was launched into the North Sea. Engulfed in an existential struggle with Spain and Portugal at the time, the Dutch Republic had still managed to become one of Europe's greatest sea-fearing trading nations. \n\nThe Batavia although a merchant ship were also equipped to be able to mount a substantial defense of her crew and cargo. Merchant ships, although not a part of the Dutch navy in peace time, were capable of fending for themselves and in times of escalating tensions with other imperial, doubled as regular navy ships.\n\nExorbitantly expensive to build, these cargo ships were nonetheless immensely profitable, and was responsible for Dutch living standards living standards being the envy of her larger European neighbors.\n\nAt the height of what historians have dubbed the Dutch golden age in the, roughly most of the 17th century, the company that owned many of these ships, the VOC, or Dutch East India company was the most valuable company in the world. \n\nSo what exactly did the ships responsible for this wealth, power and glory look like? What was it like to be a sailor on such a ship? And what were conditions like during the journey? How did they navigate? Join me as I thoroughly investigate the Batavia, a replica of a Dutch VOC ship built almost 400 years ago.....\n\n■ WEBSITE: https://www.batavialand.nl/\n- For more information on Batavia (the ship) or Batavialand (The Museum Complex) which also houses the ship, see their website for details. The money raised through ticket sales at Batavialand goes to the much needed maintenance needed to keep this marvel of engineering in mint condition so anyone who so wishes can experience it first hand.\n\n■ GETTING THERE: The Batavia ship is located 50 minutes by taxi from downtown Amsterdam in the city of Lelystad. You can also take a train or bus for a much cheaper journey. There is also a VOC replica ship at the Amsterdam Maritime Museum. I recommend visiting them both but if you only have time for one, the Batavia ship of Lelystad offers a better experience as well as having more historical and technical information available on site from the staff and volunteers.\n\n■ FRED AS GUIDE: If you wish to meet Fred, the fantastic guide you saw in this video, he volunteers on Tuesdays.

Little cuts and scrapes from thorns and branches you step on can seriously mess up your foot. It's also super painful. I stepped on such a thorn on Zanzibar and it went straight though my thick running nike shoe (the heel to be precise) and deep into my foot.\n\nThe local Masai tribes however have come up with a solution for this: make shoes from old car tyres. These shoes are not only super durable. They last for decades according to the people I've spoken to who've grown up wearing them. But they're also super strong and nothing that's grows out in the bush will be able to pierce through your car tyre shoes.\n\nIn the Masaai tribe I lived in they've come up with a slight adaption of these ubiquitous car tyre shoes and added an antenna for %g reception to the front of it. So how are these shoes made? How long does it take? And what does the finished pair of shoes look like?\n\nAfter the lesson in How to make a shoe from a car tyre there are some deleted scenes from the goat BBQ video and scenes from around the Boma with Don Jr, Mango and others.\n\n■ THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO CONTRIBUTED TO EMI'S FUNDRAISER.

        "description": "■ TANZANIA, TANGANYIKA: The life of Masai women revolves around work. They build the houses, fetch water, cook food and tend to all other domestic chores. In this episode I was able to get a little insight into how they get their water, seeing as they have no well plus how they cook without having gas or even electricity and really nothing resembling what we would recognize as a kitchen what so ever.\n\n■ SUMMARY OF PROJECT: The Boma you've now grown familiar with is living in the pre-industrial age. Without running water or even a well, and no electricity or even solar chargers, they lead a hand to mouth existence. As subsistence farmers, they survive on the crop they grow: maize. \n\nThis maize however requires a mill, which not only takes hours to reach by foot with donkeys in tow, but also cost a lot of money. If they had their own mill, not only would they save money on not using someone else's mill, but they would for the first time in the history of their existence, own an income producing asset other than the land they grow their crops on and the livestock they herd. \n\nFor this mill would mean that other nearby Masai tribes would have the option of bringing the maize they grow here as well, rather than spend hours trecking into the nearest town (something this Boma can then charge for).\n\nThe cost of acquiring the machinery is massive, but once procured, will transform the lives of everyone in this community in unimaginable ways. This is an incredible experiment I've chosen to back financially (with a substantial amount) and can't wait to see how unfolds in the years to come. \n\nEmi is the most magnanimous and selfless person I've come across since Sunil of the Leo Srhestha Foundation in Nepal and is fully committed towards improving the fate of the people in this Masai Boma she has chosen integrate with. \n\nIf you wish to support her project and help give these incredible people you've come to know over the past seven days a massive income producing opportunity and hence better life, you can read more on the link above.\n\nPS! Sharing the GoFund me link on your Facebook can also make a big difference 👍\n\n■Emi's mega project to give these Masaai women their first ever independent income stream: https://www.gofundme.com/f/maasai-womens-cooperative\n\n Liking the videos you watch help increase their reach on YouTube 🙏\n■ NEW INSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/TheNorthmanReturns",

Most of the stores are also really unique with local crafts and products you won't find in malls or abroad. I was tempted to do a shopping video just going to fixed price shops. However that would mean I'd be missing out on the Mexican bargaining experience. \n\nNothing beats a good old fashioned market bargaining experience as far as I am concerned. So I decided to go to Oaxaca's Benito Juarez market in the centre of town. (not to be confused with the tyrannical 21st November food market which have mask tyrants at every entrance and don't let free people in... but I digress).\n\nAt the Benito Juarez market I had a pretty simple plan. Fill up my shopping bag with goodies... then find a deserving local to give it to.\n\nThat however proved somewhat more difficult than initially anticipated...\n\n■ By clicking 'Like' 👍🏻 on this video you help me out massively with reaching both current subscribers and new viewers.

        "description": "■ KATHMANDU, NEPAL: Ever since I did the Himalayan Langtang trek 2 years ago, I've been dreaming of another mountain adventure. Not to copy my Langtang experience, as I consider that to be impossible as so many things went right on that trek despite me doing zero planing and it being my first multi-day trek and first time in the Himalayas, but to find something of equal beauty and novelty.\n\nThe thing is that such mountain treks is impossible to discover using Google. You simply cannot get a true feel for what a trek will be like through photos and videos from other people's journeys. You can get an idea, but reality may be nothing like what their hand-picked memories suggests.\n\nSo I decided to simply pick a random place and hope for the best. My choice fell on a trail circling the world's 7th  tallest mountain: Manaslu. The first time I attempted the Manaslu trek was 6 months ago. I failed before it had even begun as I ran into a troublesome rule which says you need a guide to walk on a simple path hundreds of people walk on everyday! 🤦🏼‍♂️\n\nSo I gave up before the trek had actually started.... mainly due to mishaps and human insanity outside of my control. Six months later I have a different plan. I shall journey up towards Manaslu mountain and then head off the beaten path where no permit check-points or insane alcoholic stalker guides exist.\n\nBut first I need to get from Kathmandu towards the foothills of the Himalayas. As I suspected, this proved to be quite the adventure in and of itself....mainly thanks to a ruthless but entertaining girl selling bananas on the outskirts of Kathmandu...\n\n■ MORE NEPAL VIDEOS 🇳🇵\n\nDOWNHILL DOGGO RESCUE 🐶\n■ https://youtu.be/YHfDqm3iVWU\n\nSURVIVING HIMALAYA 🏔️\n■ https://youtu.be/kJEA79OdefM\n\nWRONG TURN HIMALAYA 🏔️\n■ https://youtu.be/mBM2tdrp0J0",

I just wanted to say that the queues are visitors to Palazzo Vecchio are basically non-existant unlike at all other Florentine attractions.

But you'd think most people knew that the Brits ran huge parts of India as a colony for hundreds of years. \n\nIt started with trade and actually just buying stuff like cloth... then fast forward a few decades later and they're controlling the damn factories that produce the clothes and full-scale looting ensued as any Indian will tell you.\n\nHence the joke was, and I can't believe I have to explain this, that when I come into this street where no foreigners ever venture they get deja vu and take me for a British colonialist who've returned and hence attempt to subtly drive me away by refusing to sell me stuff... lest droves of Pesky Colonialists follow in my footsteps and it all happens again.\n\nIf people have a little knowledge of history they'd put 2 and 2 together and see what the supposed humour with the subtitles was here.... I see many Indians get it and thought it was funny... foreigners however 🤣🤦🏼‍♂\n\n■ MORE VIDEOS FROM 2023:\n\n■  Cycling Nepal: The Homeless Doggo 🇳🇵\nhttps://youtu.be/YHfDqm3iVWU\n\n■ Hunt For The Fine White Wine Man 🇱🇰\nhttps://youtu.be/afZliJBMk8I",

        "description": "■ AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS: The famous canals of Amsterdam are littered with houseboats in all shapes and sizes. Some are for rent but most are occupied by locals who've made a home for themselves on the water. Staying in one of these was top of my list of things to experience whilst in Amsterdam, so I opted for the priciest AirBnb houseboat I could find. A hotel room in this city is not cheap anyway so I figured it'd be worth it to pay a little extra to get the full riverboat experience. \n\nSo what does the houseboat look like inside? Is it as spacious and comfortable as a hotel room in the same price range or a normal house? Can you swim in the rivers? And last but not least, what is in my suitcase when I travel? After the houseboat tour I unpack everything.\n\nIf you wish to rent the same house boat for your Amsterdam trip search for Houseboat-Apartment Sumatra. It is available through a number of different hotel booking sites.\n\nFor daily updates from the road: https://www.instagram.com/heraldobaldieri/",

If you've been following my videos you'll be familiar with Freeman's family and their property. If not I suggest you check out some of the videos linked beneath.\n\nSo on to the house. It was completed in. December 2019 and I was the fourth guest here. The other tenants were from Russia, Ukraine and Germany. All stayed between few weeks to a month. If you're going to stay here there are Tuk-Tuks that will come to pick you up and take you to the beach but I recommend you rent their motorbike which is a Yamaha less than a year old. \n\nLocation wise, this house is for those who want something different. You'll hear the monks from a nearby temple chant into the sunset as huge bats start flying (at a safe distant) above your rooftop to a destination unbeknownst to me. There are black monkeys swinging around in the trees which you can also observe from your porch. \n\nThis is modern village lifestyle as you have all the amenities you're used to from back home in a more rural serene setting without other tourists around. \n\n■ Book your stay through Airbnb: https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/40561647\n\n■ More form this property:\nFreeman's Backyard: https://youtu.be/-jK-CQPvOTU\nFreeman's Forest: https://youtu.be/HKFyop6hVcQ\nBachelorette Neighbor: https://youtu.be/v2Ya5VliOvQ",

        "description": "■  USA, LAS VEGAS: Every time I've visited Las Vegas I ended up staying on The Strip where most of the mega hotels like The Cosmopolitan and Caesar's Palace are located. My hotel of choice have usually been Treasure Island as it's the budget friendlier option. \n\nDespite staying on The Strip, I always ended up spending most of my time in the downtown Las Vegas area known as The Freemont Experience. I like the blackjack tables there better and also the entire street has an awesome vibe with tons of characters.\n\nThis time I therefore decided to stay in the downtown area so I didn't have to waste time and money on taxis back and forth there everyday. Some of the hotels in downtown Las Vegas are 80 years old as this is where this city truly began. A couple of years ago a new hotel sprang up called Circa. I've played blackjack in there before and it looked like a nice and modern hotel so I decided to give it a go.\n\nAfter checking in to the hotel it was time for an ice-hockey match as the reigning Stanley Cup Champions Las Vegas Knights played Vancouver Canucks that evening. And with ice hockey and nightfall in Vegas come beers. Many beers......\n\n■ To become a channel member see link for more information:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKr68ZJ4vv6VloNdnS2hjhA/join\n\nNEW AMERICA VIDEOS:\n\n■ The New Orleans Experience: Beers, Goths & Alligators 🇺🇸\nhttps://youtu.be/AqylpOahV0M\n\n■ The Wyoming Experience: America's Wild West 🇺🇸\nhttps://youtu.be/HQDn7ZvQK1o\n\n■  My Instagram 🇳🇴\nTheNorthmanReturns",

An ancient marketplace which have been there since medieval days and possibly since the days of the Greek city states is still up and running today.\n\nThe market stretches for about a kilometre if you walk straight through it but if you decide to embark on a shopping side-quest in one of the many narrow alleyways of the Old Town you can add kilometres of shops to that total.\n\nObviously this was a market I was eager to make a shopping video in. My only dilemma was exactly which streets to go shopping in. I opted for staying on the main market street and for a simple challenge of spending 1000 Euros in the span of one hour. \n\nPeople don't really bargain here as the price of most items are fixed but that suited me just fine as spending the equivalent of $1100 USD in an hour would be quite the challenge and lower prices wasn't exactly conducive to helping me succeed with said mission 💵💸\n\n■ MORE MARKET SHOPPING VIDEOS: \n\n■ Surviving the Ruthless Market Stalkers of Varanasi 🇮🇳\nhttps://youtu.be/PfjgSuZgLKM\n\n■ Oaxaca Market Hunt Mexico 🇲🇽\nhttps://youtu.be/WCVfjiWxQgk\n\n■ $100 Shopping Challenge Sri Lanka Market 🇱🇰\nhttps://youtu.be/HGkrAz1NCt0",

        "description": "■ TEXAS, SAN ANTONIO: Exotic animals from all over the world (including axis deer from India) was imported to Texas in the 1930s for hunting purposes. Around the same time some of these ranches also imported wild Russian boars for the same reason. \n\nIn the wild, these Russian boars interbreed with feral hogs, meaning pigs that were once domesticated but have now gone back to live in the wild.  Said hogs have been roaming around here since the Spanish conquistadors brought them as a food supply while exploring what is today Southern United States under the leadership of people like Hernan De Soto. \n\nOften, said Conquistadors would also leave hogs behind, knowing that are capable of surviving on anything  and virtually anywhere, thus ensuring an easily accessible food supply for future expeditions.\n\nIn the years since, these pigs have been incredibly successful as a species and has established themselves across multiple State. In Texas alone their numbers stand at an estimated 2.6 million. \n\nAccording to an article in National Geographic, many researchers consider these hogs the most destructive invasive species on the planet. Here are just some of the negatives associated with them that applies locally here in Texas.\n\nFor starters these pigs are omnivores meaning they can live on plants and meat. This means they kill the fawns, i.e. young axis and white tail deers, which is the animals these ranches are built to sustain. And when they go for plants or smell something exotic potentially buried under a field of grass they don’t behave any better..\n\nUnlike cattle which graze a field until the grass is too short to chew up, hogs use their tusks to root up the grass all the way down to the soil. This destroys the fields ensuring grass and plants may not be able to grow back. Instead you’re left with mud and dirt.\n\nSecond, they also eat the food from deer feeders which is meant to sustain the deer population as well as cause immense property damage to fencing and other structures.\n\nThe owners of these farms really have no other way of managing the problem than to put these hogs down. But that is easier said than done. They mate year round and one sow, meaning a female pig, can give birth 3 times a year to a dozen piglets. These lands are also riddled with rattle snakes and as you can see here from the air are rather inaccessible by foot.\n\nOn top of that the hogs have responded to being hunted by becoming increasingly nocturnal, meaning they hide during the day and come active only at night when they’ve learnt there’s less danger in the form of human hunters about. They are also actually incredibly smart and can detect odors from up to 10 km or 7 miles away.\n\nThis explains why helicopter hog hunting was invented to try and keep the hog population in check. At first the farms used to pay teams of hunters to clean up their farms. That however costs a lot of money and wasn’t really a sustainable solution. And that’s how a group of guys which included Dustin, the pilot sitting next to me here came up with the idea of charging tourists to do this for them.\n\nAs a result the hog population goes down, deer population up, crops and fields stay productive and the owners of them get to keep more of their money whilst helicopter companies make money. \n\n■ Liking the videos you watch help increase their reach on YouTube 🙏\n■ NEW INSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/TheNorthmanReturns\n\n■■■■■ FLY WITH DUSTY ■■■■■\nhttp://www.holthelicopters.com/\n\n■ More information about Texas' wild hog problem:\n\n■ A PLAGUE OF PIGS IN TEXAS: \nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-plague-of-pigs-in-texas-73769069/\n\n■ THE BATTLE TO CONTROL AMERICA'S MOST DESTRUCTIVE SPECIES:\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/battle-to-control-america-most-destructive-invasive-species-feral-pigs",

        "description": "■ WYOMING, BIG HORN MOUNTAINS: The day before embarking on my solo hiking adventure up the tongue river canyon, I stopped at Wyoming's Fish and Game department's offices in Sheridan. I had only one question in mind; the rattle snake situation in the Big Horn mountain range. \n\nWith zero cell service in the area and hours by foot to the nearest town if anything was to go down, I wanted to figure out how likely a meeting with America's most feared snake really was. The woman I spoke to at the office flat out said she does not venture into the tongue river canyon at all this time a year due to said snake. She waits for colder weather when the snakes have set up shop in their winter caves. \n\nShe also said some friends of hers had hiked the trail a week prior and seen a rattle snake literally 3 minutes into their adventure. That was kind of the answer I expected though. \n\nAnd seeing as cancelling my hike was not an option I'd just have to thread very carefully. \n\nSo off I went, somewhat nervous, but in high spirits, blissfully unaware that this was about to become the greatest hike I've ever undertaken... and that by the end of the day I would've named and survived a new mountain called Fireball Peak 🔥 \n\n■ NEW INSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/TheNorthmanReturns",

There are several of these but only one I've seen you can actually live in.\n\nThese are not tourist traps or set up for that purpose. The floating homes in these fishing villages have been there for 600 years and people live there even today. That is also what makes them so great as it gives foreigners and incredible opportunity to see how people live and thrive out in these coves.\n\nHaving only spent one night in this floating village upon my previous visit, I was eager to go back. This time however I was not going to make the mistake of only staying for one night. \n\nI wanted to paddle a traditional plant woven boat. Hunt Gongo.

The area, noise level, cleanliness, state of the property vs. the photos you saw online and so on can leave you regretting your choice of accommodation which you may now be locked into for a week as you pre-paid before your travels.\n\nIn Vietnam you can add to the hotel equation that walking in to the reception without a booking from Booking.com, Agoda.com or Hotels.com will leave you with a vastly better price for the hotel room than if you had booked from the comfort of your living room before flying to Vietnam. \n\nAt least 20 0 30% discount can be had by simply walking in and asking for a room in the reception.\n\nThat's not the case in for example USA where the online price for hotels are always better than walking in to the hotel with a reservation.\n\nSo when in Vietnam, if time and your patience permits, going on a good old fashioned hotel hunt by foot is always the better and more entertaining option. \n\nNot only do you get a better price, plus to see the state of the hotel and neighbourhood before you decide to put your money down but you also get a free adventure!\n\nSo let's kick off this Vietnam holiday by searching for a good hotel in Hanoi the capital of Vietnam.",

What ultimately sealed the deal for me was the climate which is similar to Northern Europe. I hate leaving Europe during winters as there's nothing better than fresh ice cold air and snow covered city landscapes.\n\nSouth Korea also have that. When I landed it was -4. As usual I didn't prepare much other than a hotel. Browsing Booking.com I came a couple of days before departure I came across a boutique hotel name L'Escape Hotel boasting a French renaissance decor throughout the premises. This I had to see and experience for myself.\n\nA hotel though is usually just the icing on the cake. What makes a country cool is the people who reside there. So out I went on a street food hunt and shopping spree to figure out what Seoul, the capital of Korea, is truly like.\n\n■ Updates from the road: https://instagram.com/TheNorthmanReturns\n\n■ Luxury India Experience: https://youtu.be/2lse4PHFmZU",

I couldn't have been more wrong.  My neighbors, who own the house I'm staying in, have cooked up one delicious meal after another for the entire duration of my stay. \n\nSo what's my favorite dish thus far?

As soon as I enter New Orleans' French Quarter and wandered down the famed Bourbon street, I realised this is one of those cities that bucks the usual American trend of downtown being dead.\n\nFull of life and fantastic architecture, New Orleans has hands down the coolest American downtown area I've ever come across. Finding a historic building to stay in proved a difficult difficult task though with nothing exceptional showing up when searching through booking.com. \n\nAfter extensive research I was pointed in the direction of the Olivier House, a historic boutique hotel made up of 5 family homes built in the 1880s. This turned out to be a gem of hotel and the second best I've stayed in in USA.\n\nWith the hotel out of the way, and after picking up a Korean hobo on a park bench, I started exploring the city's bars and restaurants searching for the best local beers and food on offer.\n\nNew Orleans did NOT disappoint!\n\n■  My Instagram 🇳🇴\nTheNorthmanReturns\n\nMORE EPIC VIDEOS:\n\n■ The Wyoming Experience: America's Wild West 🇺🇸\nhttps://youtu.be/HQDn7ZvQK1o\n\n■ Mezcal Challenge Mexico 🇲🇽.

Gone are the days where you just put a couple of Dollars on a crazy wheels slot machine and your accommodation is free. Stuck between paying the sky high peak summer prices for a mediocre budget hotel room at a classic centre of the strip hotel like Flamingo, which wanted $220 a night, and the semi-luxurious The Cosmopolitan for just $100 more, I opted for the latter.\n\nVery few Las Vegas hotel rooms have a balcony like The Cosmo, plus I've never stayed at this end of the strip before. A night of reveling in a luxurious jacuzzi overlooking the famous fountains of The Bellagio would do me good I reasoned....\n\nSo did my room at The Cosmopolitan justify the insane price tag?\n\n■ For a hotel that's definitely worth the price tag, although it's located far away from Las Vegas in America's least populated state Wyoming, check out $160 Historic Occidental Wild West Hotel: https://youtu.be/GQU_tRBnPkA 🇺🇸",

All my life I've heard Norwegians use this phrase, including myself, without actually having met a single Northman who've ever walked the soil of the Lone Star Republic. \n\nThe saying likely dates back to the days of the gun slinging cowboys of the old Wild Wild West and has naturally stood the test of time as nothing is scarier to a government worshipping contemporary Norwegian than just that; people with guns ruling themselves and not waiting for orders on what to think say and do from some central authority in a far away city.\n\nBut what about modern day Texas? What is it actually like to live there? I must admit I knew next to nothing about the current state of affairs of anything in the former country which joined the United States in 1845. I've always admired the Libertarian streak that seems to run through anyone I've ever met who come from Texas though and was therefore incredibly excited to finally visit the state properly.\n\nFirst stop was San Antonio where my friend John and his son Serj met me at the airport. From there we drove to a little town I do not remember the name of but is famous for tubing adventures. Tubing is an old Texas tradition I've been told. It involves and old car tyre, beers and a river.\n\nThen off you go...\n\n■ NEW INSTAGRAM: http://www.instagram.com/TheNorthmanReturns",

Are there really artists that have kept this epic ancient craft which was the principal art form in the Byzantine empire alive? And can I order my very own custom mosaic of whatever motif I like? \n\nI had a million questions and hence spent the next week figuring it all out. Here's how it went!\n\n■ Altun Mosaic Maker: \nE-mail: atilansanatkultur@gmail.com\nWhat's App: +90 542 877 15 09\n- Whilst the easiest way to order is to meet her in her shop on Cyprus, you can also contact her and see what can be done if you live in another country. I'd recommend getting a painting though as she's incredibly skilled in capturing the scenes of Greek mythology and other historical themes on a canvas. Plus paintings are easy to ship whereas Mosaics are near impossible to transport (unless you pick it up yourself). \n\n■ TO DONATE OR READ ABOUT SUNIL'S CANCER FOUNDATION:\nhttps://www.leonardoedwardshresthafoundation.org/donate/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/leoshresthafoundation/\nhttps://www.leonepal.org\nPhone: 651.243.1234\nYou can contact Sunil through e-mail, DMs or phone.

The previous day I'd observed the local villagers not only sit out in the water when the tide was low planting seaweed, but also bringing back baskets of fully grown seaweed to the shore on their heads.\n\nNaturally I wanted in on this unique feature of the local economy.

But I still felt jet-lagged the next morning and not at all ready to go sightseeing around Seoul. I needed another night to revel in five star luxury to recover from my flight. \n\nPreferably somewhere with several restaurants, a gym and a swimming pool.\n\nA quick search on Booking.com lead me to Conrad Hotel, a five star sky-rise hotel owned by the Hilton group. The price was high but it is what it is. Luxury is never cheap so I decided to go for it. My goal for the day was to spend over $1000 USD on living life to the fullest.\n\nTo make the day more interesting I decided to take the metro to the hotel.

        "description": "■ RHODES, GREECE: The last time I was this overdue for a visit to a barber you guys called me Phuc Flair. Not wanting to repeat my long luscious blonde locks, I started scouting out barber shops around the Greek island of Rhodes the same day I landed.\n\nThere are some truly awesome looking barbershops here but the most professional looking one of them all is: Little John. It doesn't hurt that it's also located right opposite the coolest bar in town either. Getting a haircut there was a no brainer and top of my list of things to do.\n\nThe only problem was that every time I walked by he was always busy with tons of customers. \n\nSince this was the perfect location for a haircut video though and I am only interested in making barber videos if it is something new and truly unique, I decided to keep trying.\n\nWeeks went by and not once as I walked by was the place not full. With two days left of my stay I decided to simply barge in whilst someone was already getting a haircut and pitch my video idea.\n\nJohn, the owner said he'd love to do it so I scheduled an appointment for Thursday night when the bar opposite would have a live band playing.... before I sat down for my cut I decided to pay the bar a little visit..... 🍺💈\n\nIf you want to get a haircut at Little John Rhodos just walk in to make an appointment. Want to see more of his work you can follow him on instagram: littlejohn_barbershop\n\nIf you want to visit the bar find it in Google Maps: The Last Butler\n\n■ The Favela Barber 🇧🇷\nhttps://youtu.be/P9umScD5khI\n\n■ $1000 Market Hunt Rhodes: 🇬🇷\nhttps://youtu.be/cEsw7C-t7-w",

What I did not expect though was to discover a new hamburger chain that have tastier hamburgers than Burger King.\n\nAmericans in particular have been raving in my comment section for a long time about the taste of the In-N-Out Burger. Whenever I meet Americans anywhere in the world (or in any state for that matter), 9 out of 10, will when asked about their favorite hamburger, respond with: In-N-Out. \n\nSo whilst in Las Vegas with my Korean friend Mr. Noodles, I decided to try the famous In-N-Out Burger. The queue was out the door and expectations were sky high.\n\nI honestly thought I was about to eat the holy grail of hamburgers. Needless to say I was horribly disappointed. The burger was tiny and didn't even taste that good. I'd even rate McDonald's cheeseburger as the better buy.\n\nBurger King's Double Whooper would forever be the best burger I thought. Little did I know... 5 Guys was about to turn Heraldo's burger universe on its head....",

Naturally this was something I wasn't gonna miss.\n\nAfter meeting his whole family who'd just arrived back from a village visit we ventured over to the holding tanks and picked out 10 lucky turtles.

At 8:00 There was no sign of the bus. The hotel called them for me and it turns out they had forgotten to swing by my hotel me. \n\nThey sent a motorbike to fetch me so we could drive and catch up with the bus. It was the start of an uncomfortable journey. Luckily in Sa Pa a $300 luxury cabin at a 5 start hotel awaited me.

Since that Florence excursion, I've been eager to experience the city during winter. January and February are the best months to avoid the crowds of foreign tourists in Italy, as there are hardly any queues anywhere, whether at Palazzo Vecchio, Uffizi gallery or the top rated Florentine steakhouses in town. \n\nAfter landing in Rome and jumping on the airport express train to downtown, I switched to a high speed train going direct to Florence. It takes 2 hours and cost 80 Euros for a business class seat. Arriving in Florence, I walked to the famous cathedral where I had found an exquisitely decorated renaissance themed apartment on AirbnB with view of the cathedral from the bedroom window.\n\nDid the renaissance apartment live up to expectations? Were the queues at Palazzo Vecchio, Bruneleschi's dome and Ponte Vecchio really gone? Was Florentine steak as good as I remembered?

They offer a less entertaining experience as they are a more serious and formal place of business. But on the upside they generally offer higher quality products and pricier items on sale. You can find a handcrafted specialty product or a genuine antique item with serious history behind it you can value for the rest of your life.\n\nWalking around window shopping in Hanoi I noticed many unique antique stores plus local handicraft outlets. I figured this might be a good setting for the priciest Vietnam shopping video to date.\n\nSo out I went locked and loaded with The Federal Reserves in hand 💰\n\n■ If you don't see a link to Join my Members section click here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKr68ZJ4vv6VloNdnS2hjhA/join\n\n■ More Vietnam videos 🇻🇳\n\n■ $200 Shopping Challenge Saigon: https://youtu.be/zLULL-uwgJw\n■ $400 Shopping Challenge Saigon: https://youtu.be/bux1dV3xwpI\n■ Hanoi Hotel Hunt: https://youtu.be/tglQyYjltko",

I wanted to try and live on a traditional house boat but that proved a difficult undertaking.\n\nI therefore decided to book a $500 suite on an overnight luxury cruise boat. If that sounds like a steep price, please note that this is low season and that is a heavily discounted rate. Normally this luxury suite would sell for $8-900. Expectation were thus naturally high.\n\nI've always wanted to do a large cruise ship sail but found the prices and prospective accommodation to offer horrible value.

I'm sure he'll appreciate it!\n\n■ ITALY, FLORENCE: Now for the usual video description. I always love to meet people eeking out a living on their own independent of major corporations. It's not easy being an entrepreneur in Europe but the homeless Italian guy I meet a week ago whilst out doing a monologue on self-employment proves that grasroots capitalism is still alive and well, even in a heavily over-regulated nation like Italy. \n\nI therefore decided to help this awesome self-employed man out with a couple of items to sell which will hopefully net him a nice chunk of change. \n\nGood luck and happy hunting to those of you who try to buy it.",

        "description": "■ RHODES, GREECE: As one of history’s most contested and thus fought over islands, Rhodes, which today is part of Greece, is one of Europe’s hidden gems if travelling to historic places is your forte. It is still a well known holiday destination but this incredible island doesn’t get the same publicity as Europe’s other tourism heavyweights.\n\nSo since I am in Rhodes for the second summer in a row, I figured I’d do my bit in changing just that. \n\nAncient Rhodes was host to one of the earliest advanced civilisations of the Mediterranean prior to the Bronze Age collapse. A millennia later it was responsible for one of the 8 wonders of the ancient world: the colossus of Rhodes which guided ships safely into its famed harbour. \n\nMinoans, Dorians, Persians, Athenians, Romans, Byzantines, Ottomans, Italians and now Greeks finally again have all ruled this island.\n\nI skipped over one of the most prominent and famed conquerors though. It was not a kingdom, empire, nation or even an ethnic group with a single language.\n\nInstead it was a military crusading order which started out as a hospital run by traders from the Italian city state of Amalfi in what was then known as the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the year 1100 A.D. \n\nToday they are known to us as: The Knights Hospitaller or The Order of Saint John the Baptist\n\nThese bellicose monks who had picked up the sword to defend Christ and his worldly domains conquered Rhodes from the Byzantines in 1309 and ran the island for the benefit of what they called the one true faith, as their own country, for the next 213 years.\n\nNot beholden to any nation, King or Emperor and only (nominally at least) recognising the Pope as an authority figure other than their own Grandmaster, these Knights soon became Europe and Christendom’s easternmost outpost in an increasingly Ottoman corner of the Mediterranean Sea. \n\nThis video will cover some of the fascinating historical trivia surrounding this period the Knights Hospitaller ran this island as I visit one of Rhodos' oldest goldsmiths and they show us how to make a custom piece of jewelry from scratch using an ancient Rhodian method.\n\nIn between medieval history lessons and visits to the goldsmith for updates on my custom Knights Hospitaller ring order I will also wander about Rhodos Medieval old town and show you what makes Rhodes such an awesome place to holiday in from food, to shopping, beaches and hotels ⚔️\n\n\nMORE RHODOS VIDEOS: \n\n■ Luxury Barber Rhodes 🇬🇷\nhttps://youtu.be/ShP7X7UHkqM?si=NVkWn2MNIzFEs3cl\n\n■ $1000 Shopping Spree Rhodes 🇬🇷\nhttps://youtu.be/cEsw7C-t7-w?si=BQaDG_ul78DkrXSI",

This was the site of the Albigensian Crusades there the Catholic church in cahoots with the French king sought to subdue or slaughter the Cathars. The Cathars were a christian sect whom the pope viewed as heretical, quite possibly due to there refusal to pay tithe, or a tenth of ones' earnings to the church. \n\nThis whole region is littered with a ridiculously high number of epic hilltop castle ruins, many of whom were used by the Cathars to hide from the onslaught of the Frankish crusaders. \n\nThe biggest of all these structures still standing today is the Castle Peyrepertuse. To get to the castle itself one must first drive up half a mountain, then treck through a forest and up towards the top of the peak. \n\nSounds easy right? Well how about doing all this in utter darkness before the sun is up. Did I succeed?
