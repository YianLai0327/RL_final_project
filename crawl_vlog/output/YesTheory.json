The dangerous trek leads to several unfortunate deaths every year as people fall off the train.

        "description": "A few months ago I had the privilege of being able to enter and see parts of western Syria. We went to see a few of the country’s major cities and ancient historical sights. Our trip was very emotionally challenging but also beautiful in many ways. Meeting Syrians, hearing their stories and capturing a small part of what the country looks like today was not a simple goal but one I hope you will enjoy joining me on. Sending lots of love to all of the Syrians of the world. Thank you for welcoming me and teaching me about your culture.\n\nThanks Ghaidaa for the best tour I could have possibly been on. If you want to follow her stories or travel with her, follow her on instagram at https://www.instagram.com/ghaidaa_the_guide/.\n\nThank you Touma for helping me capture this trip! He has just released a video about what living in Syria is like, so please go watch it here (https://youtu.be/O_-8a-8bRkE) and follow his Instagram https://www.instagram.com/toumabittar/.\n\nThanks Fadi for opening so many doors for us to be able to see parts of the country few have been able to for a long time.

For my Cypriots watching, I wish you peace and prosperity for the future. I hope you enjoyed this piece and understand that not every single detail of the story could be highlighted. I could've spent hours going into all of the intricacies of this conflict and tried to stay balance and unbiased as I simply came an observer.\n\nVarosha is one of the largest and most tragic ghost towns on the planet. Once filled with tens of thousands of tourists every year it's been abandoned now for about 47 years... The conflict in Cyprus is far from being resolved and unfortunately is growing in complexity as the years go by.

From a stranger you just met, old friends or your family, SPARK is designed to both ignite a connection and give you ideas for adventures to go on together!\n\nThere are 200 questions and 200 ideas for adventures… We cannot wait to hear about all of the connections and adventures that will get ignited through this game ⚡️❤️ ⚡️LET’S GO!!\n\nWOLVES:\nTHANK YOU to Paula and Steve from Apex Protection Project for being such dedicated wolf savers. It is people like them who dedicate their lives to the service of others whether it be people or animals that help make our planet a better place.\n\nThey need help! With both donations or volunteering in person. You can find all the info you’ll need for that here:\nhttps://www.apexprotectionproject.org\n\nThese wolves were all abandoned by their owners as people continue to adopt them thinking having a wolf will be fun to have but it is an extremely time consuming and difficult task to raise one. Please do not contribute to this problem and instead go volunteer at a sanctuary and help them get protected in the wild.\n\nTo take action on a larger level, please take 5-10min to go to this website https://www.relistwolves.org it will give you all the info on who your legislator is, how to contact them, pre-written emails and everything you can do to help wolves, made as easy as possible for you.\n\nThis isn’t just about wolves however, it’s about all species on the planet and protecting our ecosystem.

Thank YOU, YES FAM.\n\nThere are so many incredible people to thank so here they are:\n\nThe Yes Theory squad that we wouldn't be able to do any of this with, Our in-house post-production guru leader, TD @thomasdajer, our badass manager Zack @zack.thecreator and Creative Director @gracie_norton. \n\nAndreas Hem, the best filmmaker we've ever met. He's directed, filmed and edited a lot of the footage you see here. You can find him on his incredible YouTube channel (youtube.com/andreasahem). Tell him we say hi :)\n\nThe family and friends that came with us to the jump: Colin and Samir, Helena and Fred Brag, and Tom.\n\nOf course, thank you to Will Smith for accepting this challenge in the first place. Without him, none of this would have been possible. He is as incredible in person as he is on the screen. A true gentleman with a great heart.\n\nThank you to his team @WestBrook and Overbrook for helping us put this together.\n\nThank you to @YouTube for trusting us with this idea and organizing the whole live production.\n\nThank you to everyone at Fly On The Wall @flyonthewallent and our personal producer, Brian, for putting together such a smooth and outstanding event.\n\nThank you to the whole stunt team including TJ White @tminusproductions for keeping Ammar and Will safe throughout.\n\nThank you to Alfonso Ribeiro @therealalfonsoribeiro for hosting the live event so freaking well.\n\nThank you to Ala Stanford @dralastanford and her medical team for checking up on Ammar and Will to make sure their health was in the right condition for the stunt.\n\nThank you to the Navajo Nation for allowing us to do this on their land.

After hearing his story, I knew I wanted to meet him. Little did I know Xavier would beat all the odds and that we would get to know each other and become brothers. \n\nOver three months of getting to know him, he taught me about what it means to fight for your life, to love unconditionally and to appreciate every single breath. He always wanted to start a YouTube channel and I told him that no matter what, his story would be told. He took comfort in that. Here is that story. \n\nI know he's here with us. I know he's watching this video and smiling at these beautiful moments we got to spend with each other. I miss him and I know I'll see him again one day. \n\nThank you for watching.

It's all based on randomness, and that's the reason we chose a dice. Ammar and Thomas got to take along New Balance Lacrosse star, Trevor Baptiste, while Matt spent time in Trevor's world as a lacrosse player. Along the way of course, strangers became a part of the whole adventure. Enjoy!\n\nBig thank you to our friends and amazing filmmakers Colin and Samir for helping us out.

Some of you might not agree with Ammar's decision to stay in the U.S. but at the end of the of day, it's his and his only. Having this emotional weight over our shoulders while traveling in Egypt did make it harder to focus on videos sometimes but it was a trip that was necessary for us all.\n\nThe Super 8-effect and music choice was completely inspired by Adrian Bliss and his amazing piece:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPtINdYoz3c\n\nSONG by Tom Rosenthal:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/adrian-bliss-2/tom-rosenthal-home-cover\n\nMerch: https://www.fanofafan.co/collections/yes-theory-merch\n\nFollow us on twitter for those exclusives! www.twitter.com/yestheory\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to figure out our secrets, what we've learned and what we think you should know: www.yestheory.com/newsletter\n\nIf you want to support us, we have merch and we'd really appreciate if you gave it a look :) https://www.fanofafan.co/collections/yes-theory-merch\n\nAll music from Epidemic Sound.

After Ammar took Seekers on adventures this year and also sponsored Nelly Attar to climb K2, I would like to also say thank you to those who support us through Seek Discomfort this holiday by taking a small group of 3 of you who purchase from Seek this Holiday on an adventure somewhere next year. We will contact the 3 adventurers by January 31st. If you have already purchased this holiday, you're already good to go :) if you'd like a chance to join me, you know where to go! ⚡️ ⚡️ ⚡️ \n\n🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort\n\nWhen it comes to what happened at the end.. It really shook me, we felt with the local team that we'd really prepared the best we could but sometimes unexpected problems like this one can happen. We've checked several times and everyone there is fine, they were really just looking for me. Nothing like this had really happened before even though I have experience traveling to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Mauritania and I understand that there are things you can and cannot do.

I decided to do so now, to bridge a deep gap that I have felt for many years now, between what my life has been in the real world and what my life is on here. I know so many have gone through or are currently going through something similar, and I hope that creating a space where we can talk about this can help us all feel less alone. If you have experienced grief, loss or pain, and if you have the strength to do so, I would love it if this comment section could be filled with stories, love and support for one another. Life is confusing and painful, we need each other to make it through.\n\nStaffan and I decided to record a podcast about this because there was so much more to say:\nhttps://youtu.be/YsgarNrWGLI",

He was also the product manager who launched the the \"Like\" button for the social network in 2009.\n\nIn our episode with Jared, he shared his perspective on the \"Like\" button and told us some insider stories about the early days of Facebook and his work with Mark Zuckerberg.

Reach out to them if you're planning to go to Syria:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/golden.team.syria/\n\nThis is one of the hardest stories we've ever had to tell. Experiencing Syria today, speaking to both our Christian Syrian friend Touma and our Palestinian/Syria friend Ghaidaa, we learned what life was truly like growing up here.\n\nWe know many parts in here will be shocking, thought provoking or hard to swallow for many, but we feel responsible to share this story after what we experienced and heared.\n\nOur intention here is to share real-life witness stories of our friends we've learned to love and through that to shed light on the realities of our world today.\n\nA few days after we left, revenge attacks were committed against people of the Alawite Sect and Christians, which we were devastated to see. Although some are celebrating their recent freedom, many are living in fear in the country today and we pray that peace will ultimately prevail in the country and between all in the region.\n\nAs humans, we deserve a world of peace. We've spent too many years in wars causing generational damage to entire populations, and it's still happening today in Gaza and the West Bank. May we come to our senses and demand peace from our leaders.\n\nMany will interpret a call for peace as a political statement, that is for you to decide. We just do not believe that violence especially against tens of thousands of civilians is the path to any sort of long-term solution.\n\nSending love to all of you watching this story today. And may peace find you wherever you are.\n\nWho are we? \nWe believe life’s greatest moments and deepest connections exist outside your comfort zone.\n\n🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort \n⚡️ SEEK DISCOMFORT: http://seek-discomfort.com/yes-theory\n\nJOIN OUR COMMUNITY\n⁺ Seek Discomfort: https://www.youtube.com/seekdiscomfort\n📸 Instagram -  https://www.instagram.com/yestheory/\n🐦 Twitter - https://twitter.com/yestheory\n🎬  Facebook- https://www.facebook.com/yestheory/\n📱TikTok - https://www.tiktok.com/@yestheory/\n\n☮️ If you want to join the Yes Fam Facebook group which is 100,000+ of our most engaged and badass community members, you can apply here: \nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/yesfam/\n\nWe’re partners with our favorite hotel in the world, CitizenM.

        "description": "Hi! First of all, we'd like to start by thanking you for all of the support on our last video. Our simple message of love, co-existence and tolerance was very important to us and we're happy so many people were touched by it. As the past few days unfolded we realized our video was being watched but we weren't sure if it was being heard. So as a means for YOU to truly choose Love Over Fear, we want you to manifest in real life. Whether it is talking to a stranger at the bus stop, in line at the grocery store or any setting you feel comfortable with. We want you and all of us to realize that EVERYONE is afraid to some degree. Ammar is afraid of people attacking his religion when in fact there are 1.6 billion muslims on the planet exercising their belief peacefully.

        "description": "Our Instagram: www.instagram.com/yestheory\n\nAlright guys, we've been uploading 2 videos a week for about 8 months in a row now. It's been a crazy ride to sustain since many of our videos take several days to film, but it's been an incredible ride. Our goal is to INCREASE the number of videos we post on this channel with a TON new ideas. The problem is we don't have time to plan out these new ideas right now and we also don't have the editing resources to handle the production value we want to accomplish. SO, we are scaling back to 1 weekly video on Sundays for about 4-6 weeks until we create a sustainable system.. then we'll eventually start scaling up to 2-3 and then potentially more... Lot's of exciting things ahead and we're glad you're coming along with us.\n\nNOW, we're also SO hyped to release 5 Project 30 episodes a week from Monday-Friday on Instagram. They're made to be watched on your phone so Instagram was the perfect home for these episodes. Can't wait to see you there! www.instagram.com/yestheory\n\nFollow us on twitter for those exclusives! www.twitter.com/yestheory\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to figure out our secrets, what we've learned and what we think you should know: www.yestheory.com/newsletter\n\nIf you want to support us, we have merch and we'd really appreciate if you gave it a look :) https://www.fanofafan.co/collections/yes-theory-merch\n\nAll music from Epidemic Sound.
